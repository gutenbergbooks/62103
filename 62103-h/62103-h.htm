<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p>A visit to the public library of many towns and cities of
five to twenty thousand inhabitants, and inquiry among persons
of considerable and even college education, reveals a
widespread unacquaintance with the writings of our foreign-born
citizens. Seldom does one find the books of more than
four or five of these authors upon the shelves of the smaller
public and college libraries; yet these institutions are doing
much to develop public opinion in countless communities made
up for the most part of native Americans who have hitherto
been largely ignorant of and indifferent to the condition and
aims of the foreign population, but whose intelligent and
sympathetic interest in the foreign-born must be aroused if
the great gulf between the two is to be bridged.</p>

<p>The funds of many libraries, it is true, are so limited as to
preclude the purchase of a majority of these books, worth
while as they are; yet the splendid American spirit to be
found in many of them ought to be more familiar to Americans,
whether native or foreign-born. This volume of selections
is offered, therefore, not as an equivalent for the reading
of the complete works here represented, but to help stimulate
a more general interest in their authors and in books
of this type, and to show with a cumulative emphasis the
essence of the genuine Americanism with which these writings
are imbued.</p>

<p>As one reads these and other works of the foreign-born in
historical sequence, he will notice that their manner of writing
has become less reflective and philosophical and more
critical and impassioned, but that keeping pace there has
been an intense and burning patriotism. The early colonists
and immigrants were seldom touched except in their
political liberties; recent immigrants have been growing increasingly
sensitive to the infringement of their social and
economic rights. This, of course, is a quality not peculiar
to the writings of the foreign-born, but is incident to the
modern industrial and social situation with conditions very<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
different from those obtaining in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. The struggle against social forces with
their great complexity and ever renewed and boundless energy
has demanded of the recent immigrants the highest
qualities for success.</p>

<p>Nearly all the selections included in this volume will be
found charged with a strong human quality, revealing the
poignant homesickness of the stranger in a new world, his
sensitiveness, his forward-looking hope, his realization of
both the humorous and the tragic side of his case, his fine
hero-worship, his firm belief in the unique mission and high
destiny of his adopted country, and his faith in the brotherhood
of man and the dawning of a new day upon the earth.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of this introduction to plead for
any particular immigration policy. Whether we shall adopt
one of rigid restriction or assume a liberal attitude, and what
shall be the bases of the selection of the immigrant in the
future, are questions to be answered not by the petty politician,
the unscrupulous demagogue, the uninformed provincial,
or the alarmists of little faith who, in their hysteria,
would completely reverse the traditions of the nation by
closing the gates entirely, but are matters to be determined
by fair-minded and representative leaders after a careful and
unbiased study of the problem in its various economic, social
and national aspects. The chief concern here is with our
attitude toward the millions of unassimilated immigrants
already among us. To them it would be well for most of
us to give our attention before attempting to solve the intricate
and perplexing question of an immigration policy.
Perhaps if we did, we might get more light and arrive at a
more unanimous and consistent conclusion regarding the admission
of those who are now said to be ready in such great
numbers to knock at our gates.</p>

<p>In these selections, it is believed, will be found convincing
proof that to try to educate and Americanize the foreign-born
by force is not only unwise and will prove futile, because
it flies in the face of the principles of human nature,
but is also unnecessary. Still, the dejection on the part of<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
many persons over our apparent failure to assimilate the immigrant
is truly pathetic. But why so much despair about
this, when countless thousands of native Americans have
little or no realizing sense of the duties of citizenship? Who
is the more culpable, the man who, being in a new land
and often lonely and neglected, finds it difficult to overleap
the barriers of timidity and suspicion and a foreign language
and strange customs, in order to seize the larger opportunities;
or the man who, though born and reared in the
midst of all the advantages of American life, fails to appreciate
his precious heritage and treats with indifference or
abuses the sacred right of franchise? Certainly hostility and
neglect will accomplish nothing, where hospitality and helpfulness
may go far to induce the newcomers to avail themselves
of the opportunities and responsibilities open to them
in America.</p>

<p>An illustration of how readily the foreigner may respond
to the least show of kindness and fellowship is afforded by
the following incident. A traveller on a west-bound train
out of New York was accosted by a young Italian immigrant,
who handed him a card of the Italian Immigration Society
on the reverse of which was written, “Please direct this man
to Santa Cruz train.” Now it happened that the American
had once visited Italy and had picked up a smattering of the
language, and partly by this and partly by the use of signs
he did his best to convey the desired information. He then
asked the young man into his own seat; and, as they talked
together of Italy and the places the American had visited,
the youth’s face glowed with the joy of remembrance. And
then it was revealed that this sturdy and warm-hearted Italian,
from whom the American might have turned as from a
“dago” and “scum of the earth,” was one of the heroes of
the Great War; that he had been wounded in the terrible
disaster of Caporetto, and had received from the Italian
minister of war testimonials and medals for gallant conduct
in battle.</p>

<p>It is at least a question whether a vast amount of time,
energy, and money has not been misspent in a hysterical endeavor<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
to get the adult immigrant to change his vernacular
and foreign ways. Realizing from my own experience, both
as a student and as a teacher of English to foreigners, the
immense effort necessary to acquire even a rudimentary
knowledge of a strange language after the plastic period of
youth has passed, I am convinced that too much stress may
be laid upon the importance of the mere acquisition of the
English language by the adult immigrant.</p>

<p>A change in the manners and customs of the immigrant
has undoubtedly a useful and necessary part in his Americanization;
but undue emphasis upon mere externals may,
with its false implications, easily create erroneous impressions.
Just now there comes to mind in this connection an
illustration prominently displayed upon the front page of one
of our most respected periodicals,&mdash;a photograph of an immigrant
mother standing between her two sons, one of whom
is garbed in American hat and overcoat, the other in uncouth
workaday attire. Beneath the picture appears this question,
“Which is Americanized?” One feels he must protest
against the shallow and all too prevalent thinking which
finds in the mere alteration of language and dress the essentials
of Americanism, and which consequently has so little
constructive and farsighted assistance to give to the momentous
work of Americanization. It has been far too frequently
demonstrated that a person may not only wear
American clothes and speak English fluently, but may have
been educated from his youth up in American institutions
without being really Americanized.</p>

<p>The elder generation should, of course, be aided in every
reasonable and practicable way; but it should soberly be
borne in mind that it is going to take decades, if not centuries,
to Americanize America, and that the hope of the nation
is in the children, both native and foreign-born. It is a
splendid demonstration of the truth of this that the most
fervid tributes to America come from the lips of those who
have arrived in the United States in the impressionable years
of youth. If, then, the rate of progress toward perfection
is to be appreciably accelerated, there must be much more<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
liberality in the support of the public schools and other educational
and humanizing institutions.</p>

<p>What is an American, or what is Americanism? Many
persons to-day are asking this question, to which perhaps
only the future can give a complete answer. I venture to
say, however, that an American is not one who expects to
find in the United States Utopian conditions, but one who
realizes the imperfections of American society and yet has
faith in the ultimate goal toward which the diverse human
elements here are struggling; that he is one who does not
seek or propose any single panacea for the ills of the nation,
but who, above all else, is conscious of his spiritual unity with
those American minds that are striving in the sanest and best,
though various, ways for the attainment of the high ends for
which the republic was founded, and that desire to see the
golden rule and “reason and the will of God” prevail in
American life.</p>

<p>And it is just this consciousness of spiritual unity that is
perhaps the most intense and valuable element in the writings
of those who have paid the highest price for their citizenship,
and that is so well worth bringing to the attention of those
who, whether native or foreign-born, have never passed from
the “centre of indifference” into the “everlasting yea” of
patriotism and national feeling.</p>

<p>Much available and appropriate material has of necessity
been omitted from this compilation, periodical articles in
particular, with two exceptions, being excluded. But
although the selections chosen constitute the utterances of
only a small minority of the foreign-born, it is felt that their
validity and representative character are not impaired. It
must be remembered that there are thousands of American
citizens of foreign birth leading contented and useful lives,&mdash;lawyers,
physicians, clergymen, artists, teachers, and craftsmen,
whose ideals and life-work have either not found expression
in books, or whose writings have been impersonal in
character, but who, if they were to write down their feelings,
would express themselves in sentiments similar to
those of their gifted compatriots of literary tendencies; and<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
even among the inarticulate mass there is a potential devotion,
which, under the proper conditions, can be kindled into
an ardent loyalty and patriotism.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt once said, in writing the foreword to
one of the works here quoted: “When we tend to grow disheartened
over some of the developments of our American
civilization, it is well worth while seeing what this same
civilization holds for starved and eager souls who have elsewhere
been denied what here we hold to be as a matter of
course, rights free to all&mdash;although we do not, as we should
do, make these rights accessible to all who are willing with
resolute earnestness to strive for them.” That in part has
been the aim in bringing these selections together. It is
hoped that they may contribute not a little to a better understanding
between America, new and old, and that they may
help to allay the fears of those who have been inclined to
ascribe most of our national ills to the presence among us of
the foreign-born, and who have had their share in the “wave
of blind distrust of the foreigner” which has recently swept
over the land. Surely, no one is justified in judging the
foreign-born, or is worthy or fitted to aid in educating them
in regard to the duties of citizenship, unless he has first acquainted
himself with their hopes, their disappointments,
their aspirations, the travail and pathos of their new birth,
and their deep-rooted love for America, as set forth in their
own writings; for these are probably the strongest Americanization
documents we possess and one of the surest proofs of
the soundness of our institutions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PHILIP SCHAFF</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is as a theologian and as editor of the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia
and other religious works that Philip Schaff is chiefly known;
but there is a slighter work of his which hardly deserves the neglect
into which it has fallen,&mdash;that is, his address on “American Nationality,”
delivered before the Irving Society of the College of St.
James, Maryland, June 11th, 1856. He was born at Coire, Switzerland,
and was educated at the Stuttgart Gymnasium and at the
universities of Tübingen, Halle and Berlin. After traveling for a
while as a private tutor he was called to a professorship in the
theological seminary of the German Reformed Church at Mercersburg,
Pennsylvania, and came to the United States in 1844. In
1870 he accepted the professorship of sacred literature in Union
Theological Seminary, New York City. He revisited Europe several
times, on one occasion going to Russia in behalf of oppressed people
there. It is not unnatural that one who was born in a land that
has sheltered so many nationalities, and where a strong spirit of
liberty has always existed, should have so keen and farsighted an
appreciation of the meaning and influence of the cosmopolitan
character of the American nation.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_21" class="pagenum">[21]</span></p>


<h3>Cosmopolitan Character of American
Nationality</h3>


<p>By nationality we understand the peculiar genius of a people
which animates its institutions, prompts its actions and
begets a feeling of common interest and sympathy. It is not
the result of any compact, but an instinct of human nature
in its social capacity, an expansion of the inborn love of self
and kindred. To hate his own countrymen is as unnatural
as to hate his own brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Nationality grows with the nation itself and acts as a powerful
stimulus in its development. But on the other side it
presupposes an organized state of society and is the result of
a historical process. Barbarians have no nationality, because
they are no nations, but simply material for nations. It is
not only the community of origin and language, but also the
community of rights and duties, of laws and institutions, of
deeds and sufferings, of freedom and oppression, of literature
and art, of virtue and religion, that enters into the definition
of a nation and gives vigor to the sense of nationality. Historical
reminiscences of glory and woe, whether preserved in
monuments, or written records, or oral traditions, popular
songs and national airs, such as “God save the Queen,”
“Ye mariners of England,” “Rule, Britannia,” “Scots wha
hae with Wallace bled,” “Allons enfants de la patrie,” “Was
ist des Deutschen Vaterland,” “The Star Spangled Banner,”
“Hail, Columbia,” contribute powerfully to strengthen the
national tie and to kindle the fire of national enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Nationality begets patriotism, one of the noblest of natural
virtues that has filled the pages of history with so many heroic
deeds and sacrifices. Who can read without admiration the
immortal story of Gideon, Leonidas, Cincinnatus, Horatius
Cocles, William Tell, Arnold von Winkelried, the Maid of<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
Orleans, John Hampden, Prince William of Orange,
Andreas Hofer, George Washington, who lived or died for
their country?</p>

<p>True patriotism does not imply hatred or contempt of foreigners,
and is entirely compatible with a proper regard for
the rights and welfare of other nations, just as self-love and
self-respect may and should coexist with the most generous
philanthropy. A narrow-minded and narrow-hearted nationalism
which walls out the life of the world, and for this
very reason condemns itself to perpetual imprisonment in the
treadmill of its own pedantry and conceit, may suit semi-barbarians,
or the stagnant heathen civilization of China and
Japan<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, but not an enlightened Christian people. True and
false nationalism and patriotism are related to each other, as
self-love to selfishness. The first is a law of nature, the second
a vice. We respect a man in the same proportion in
which his self-love expands into love of kindred and country,
and his patriotism into love of humanity at large. Washington
was always generous to the enemy and was the first to
establish amicable relations with England after the conclusion
of the American war. The Christian religion, which
commands us to love God supremely and our neighbor as ourselves,
tends to purify and elevate patriotism, like every other
natural virtue, by emancipating it from the selfish, overbearing,
all-grasping passion of conquest, and making it contributory
to the general welfare of the human family. One
of the noblest acts of the English nation, as a nation, is the
disinterested abolition of the African slave trade.</p>

<p>The events of modern times tend more and more to break
down the barriers between the nations, to bring the ends of
the earth together and to realize the unity and universality
of the human race.</p>

<p>This we must steadily keep in view, if we would understand
the distinctive character and mission of the <em>American</em>
nation, i. e., the people of the United States, who are emphatically
called by that name, as the chief bearers of the<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
historical life and future significance of the entire Western
Continent.</p>

<p>In discussing this interesting topic, we shall avoid, of
course, the whirlpool of party politics, and endeavor to rise
above those violent sectional strifes, which, for some time
past, have been and are still agitating our country on the
question of the true nature of Americanism.</p>

<p>Of all the great nations of the earth none has entered into
existence under more favorable auspices and prospects, none
is better prepared and more clearly called to represent a
compact, well defined and yet expansive, world-embracing
nationality, than the American. Our motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E Pluribus
Unum</i>, is an unconscious prophecy of our national character
and destiny, as pointed out by the irresistible course of events
and the indications of Providence. Out of many nations,
yea, out of all the nations of Christendom, is to be gathered
the one cosmopolitan nation of America on the strong and
immovable foundation of the Anglo-Saxon race....</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to an analysis of the different elements,
which enter into the composition of the American nationality
and will, in their combined action, enable it to fulfil its great
destiny.</p>

<p>It is evident to the most superficial observer that the basis
of our national character is English. It is so, not only in
language, but also in manners and customs, in our laws and
institutions, in the structure of our domestic, political and
ecclesiastical life, in our literature and religion. It is perfectly
idle to think that this country will ever become German,
or French, or Irish, or Dutch. Let them emigrate by
hundreds of thousands from the continent of Europe, they
will modify and enrich, but they can never destroy or materially
change the Anglo-Saxon ground-element of the American
people....</p>

<p>But with all due regard for good old England, America
is by no means intended to be a mere copy or continuation of
it. If our nationality, owing to its youth and the many foreign
elements still entering into its composition, is less solid
and compact than that of our older brother, it is, on the<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
other hand, more capable of expansion and development; it
is composed of a greater variety of material and destined ultimately
for more comprehensive ends by the Almighty Ruler
of nations, who assigned us not an island, but a continent
for a home, and two oceans for a field of action.</p>

<p>If ever a nation was laid out on a truly cosmopolitan basis
and gifted with an irresistible power of attraction, it is the
American. Here where our globe ends its circuit seems to
terminate the migration of the human race. To our shores
they come in an unbroken stream from every direction. Even
the tribes of Africa and Asia are largely represented
amongst us and call our country their home. But whatever
may be the ultimate fate of the red man, the negro and the
Chinese, who are separated from us by the unsurmountable
difference of race, it is evident that all the civilized nations
of Europe, especially those of Germanic origin, have contributed
and will continue to contribute to our stock. They
meet here on the common ground of freedom and equality,
to renew their youth and to commingle at last into one
grand brotherhood, speaking one language, pervaded by one
spirit, obeying the same laws, laboring for one aim, and filling
in these ends of the earth the last and the richest chapter in
the history of the world. As Europe is a great advance on
the civilization of Asia, so we have reason to believe that
America will be in the end a higher continuation of the consolidated
life of Europe. The eyes of the East are instinctively
turned to the West, and civilization follows the march
of the sun.</p>

<p>The history of the colonization and growth of this country
strongly supports the view here taken. The descendants of
England were indeed the chief, but by no means the only
agents in the Colonial period. The Dutch on the banks of
the Hudson, the Swedes on the Delaware, the Germans in
Pennsylvania and the neighboring States, the Huguenots in
South Carolina, New York and Boston, were amongst our
earliest and most useful settlers. In a more recent period
Scotland, Ireland and all parts of Germany have made the
largest contributions to our population. Florida, California<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
and New Mexico are of Spanish origin. The French
claimed once by right of exploration and partial occupation
the immense central valley from the Gulf of St. Lawrence
to the Gulf of Mexico, and between the Alleghenies and
the Rocky Mountains; and although these possessions have
long since been ceded to England and the United States,
the French element can never be entirely effaced on the banks
of the lower Mississippi or in Canada East.</p>

<p>In the Revolutionary War the descendants of the Continental
Europeans, especially the Germans of Pennsylvania
and Virginia, in proportion to their number, fought with as
much zeal and success and shed their blood as freely for the
independence of the country as the Anglo-Americans. Some
of them, as the Muhlenbergs and the Hiesters, acquired considerable
distinction as officers of the army or members of the
first Congress.</p>

<p>But a number of our most eminent Revolutionary heroes
were not even native Americans, but came from different nations
to offer us the aid of their means, their enthusiasm,
their military skill and experience in the hour of trial. The
Irish Montgomery died for us at the gates of Quebec. General
Mercer, who fell in the battle of Princeton, was a
native of Scotland. Kosciusko, the Pole, paid his early vows
to liberty in our cause, and his countryman, Pulaski, perished
for it at Savannah. The noble Germans, Baron de Kalb,
who shared with Gaines the glory of capturing Burgoyne
and fell in the battle of Camden in South Carolina, bleeding
of seven wounds, and Steuben, the pupil of Frederic the
Great, and the Seven Years War, who left a handsome pension
to serve his adopted country and helped to decide the
day at Yorktown, crowned in the new world the high military
reputation which they had previously acquired in the
old; they were amongst the most experienced officers in the
American army, and did it essential service, especially by
training, with immense labor, the raw recruits, and preparing
them for the victories of the battle-field. Our Congress
knew well how to appreciate their merits, by erecting to the
former a monument at Annapolis, and by voting to the latter<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
a handsome annual pension, to which the legislatures of
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York added large donations
of land. France threw the weight of her powerful
moral influence and material aid into our scale, and sent us
the Count de Rochambeau, Baron de Viomenil, and especially
the Marquis of Lafayette, the citizen of two worlds,
whose name will be handed down to the latest American, as
well as French posterity, in inseparable connection with
Washington. The West Indies gave us Alexander Hamilton,
who fought gallantly in the war, and, after its conclusion,
organized our financial credit and took the most distinguished
part in the formation and defence of our Federal
Constitution, thus joining to the laurels of the battle-field the
more enduring honors of peace, like his friend, the Father
of his Country, whom we justly revere and love as “first in
war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.”</p>

<p>Thus all the leading nations of Christendom were actively
and honorably represented in the first settlement of our
country, and in that great struggle which resulted in the
birth of a new nation, and thus earned a title to a share in
the blessings of its freedom....</p>

<p>As long, then, as we have such an immense body of land
waiting for living men, and such a gigantic task of the future
before us, there is no cause to discourage immigration. Let
this continent of land continue to attract another continent
crowded with men, that they may thus both prove a blessing
to each other. How could we cherish a proscriptive spirit
without striking at the fundamental creed and glory of our
institutions? How could we indulge in hatred of foreigners
and shut the gate to the stranger, without insulting the memory
of our own fathers and of the fathers of this country?
Let us never forget the sacred trust of civil and religious
liberty committed to us; never forget our past history and
our comprehensive destiny. Ourselves the children of the
pilgrims of a former generation, let us welcome the pilgrims
of the present day, and open a hospitable asylum to the oppressed
and persecuted of every Christian nation. Favored<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
by the free gift of Providence with a territory almost as
large as Europe, and capable of sustaining ten times the
amount of our present population, let us cordially invite and
encourage the immigrants, till prairies and forests, and mountains
and valleys resound with the songs of living men and
the praises of God.</p>

<p>Here are our millions of acres stretching towards the setting
sun and teeming with hidden wealth, that must be made
available for the benefit of society. Here is room enough
for all the science, learning, art, wisdom, virtue and religion
of Europe, that, transplanted into a virgin soil and breathing
the atmosphere of freedom, they may bring forth new blossoms
and fruit and open a new epoch in the onward march
of civilization. Here is the general congress of the noblest
nations of Christendom, the sterling, energetic Briton; the
strong-willed, enterprising Scotch; the hard-working, generous
Irish; the industrious, deep-thinking German; the honest,
liberty-loving Swiss; the hardy, thrifty Scandinavian;
the even-tempered, tenacious Dutch; the easy, elegant
Frenchman; the earnest, dignified Spaniard; the ingenious,
imaginative Italian; the patriotic, high-minded Magyar and
Pole,&mdash;that they might renew their youth, and, laying aside
their prejudices and defects and uniting their virtues, may
commingle into the one American nation, the freest, the
most enlightened, the most comprehensive of all, the nation
of the new world, the nation of the future....</p>

<p>The destiny and mission of such a cosmopolitan nation
can hardly be estimated. It must be majestic as our rivers,
magnificent as the Niagara Falls, lofty as the Rocky Mountains,
vast as our territory, deep as the two oceans around
it, far-reaching as the highways of commerce that already
carries our name and influence to the remotest regions of the
globe. History points to a boundless future before it, and
nothing can prevent it from filling the most important pages
in the annals of coming centuries [except] its own unfaithfulness
to its providential trust....</p>

<p>Such high views on the destiny of our nation, so far from
nourishing the spirit of vanity and self-glorification, ought<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
rather to humble and fill us with a deep sense of our responsibility
to the God of nations, who entrusted us with a great
mission for the world and the Church, not from any superior
excellency of our own, but from free choice and an inscrutable
decree of infinite wisdom. Nor should we forget that
there are fearful tendencies and dangers growing up in our
national life, which threaten to unfit us for our work and to
expose us to the judgment of the Almighty Ruler of the Universe,
who is not bound to any particular human instrumentality,
but can raise a new generation on the ruins of our own
to carry out His designs. It is only in steady view of these
dangers, and by an earnest struggle against evil temptations,
that we can at all succeed and accomplish the great ends for
which Providence has called us into existence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FRANCES D’ARUSMONT</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Frances D’Arusmont, better known as Frances Wright, was born
in Dundee, Scotland. She seems to have inherited the intellectuality
and liberal feeling of her father, who was a man of independent
means and considerable accomplishments. Scarcely three years after
her birth in 1795, she lost both her parents and was brought up by
a maternal aunt in England. She was largely self-educated, and
from early youth was keenly interested in history, particularly the
history and condition of the United States. This interest found definite
expression in her determination to sail for America in 1818,
where she spent two years in the States, publishing in 1821 her
“Views of Society and Manners in America,” a series of letters to a
friend in England. While it is true that these letters are filled with
prepossessions, they had a wholesome effect in counterbalancing a
great deal of ignorance about and prejudice against the United
States at that time. After going back to Europe for a short stay,
she returned to the United States in 1824, eager to solve the slave
question. In pursuance of this desire she bought a tract of land in
Tennessee, about fourteen miles northwest of Memphis, and settled
negro slaves on it, in the hope that they would work out their own
liberty and that the Southern planters would be induced to follow
her example. The experiment proved a failure, and, with health
broken, she was ordered to Europe by her physician. On returning
to America again, she became a member of Robert Owen’s colony
at New Harmony in Indiana, and with the assistance of Robert
Dale Owen conducted a socialistic journal. At this time she frequently
appeared on the lecture platform in many parts of the country.
During one of her numerous trips to Europe she was married in
France to M. Phiquepal-D’Arusmont. She died at Cincinnati in
1852.</p>

<p>Though no fanatic, Frances D’Arusmont had several qualities of
the visionary, courage and enthusiasm without prudence and judgment.
It is greatly to her credit and honor, however, that she was
among the first to realize the importance of the slavery question and
to make an effort to settle it amicably. It is to be regretted that
she did not devote her life solely to the solution of this momentous
problem.</p>

<p>The selection here given from her “Views of Society and Manners
in America,” follows the text of the first New York edition, 1821.</p></div>

<h3>THE CONSTITUTION AND ESTABLISHMENT
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</h3>

<p>What is most worthy of admiration in the history of
America is not merely the spirit of liberty which has ever
animated her people, but their perfect acquaintance with the
science of government, which has ever saved that spirit from
preying on itself. The sages who laid the foundation of her
greatness possessed at once the pride of freemen and <em>the
knowledge of English freemen</em>; in building the edifice, they
knew how to lay the foundation; in preserving untouched
the rights of each individual, they knew how to prevent his
attacking those of his neighbor: they brought with them the
experience of the best governed nation then existing; and,
having felt in their own persons the errors inherent in that
constitution, which had enlightened, but only partly protected
them, they knew what to shun as well as what to imitate
in the new models which they here cast, leisurely and
sagely, in a new and remote world. Thus possessed from the
beginning of free institutions, or else continually occupied in
procuring or defending them, the Colonies were well prepared
to assume the character of independent States. There
was less of an experiment in this than their enemies supposed.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Nothing, indeed, can explain the obstinacy of
the English ministry at the commencement of the Revolutionary
struggle but the supposition that they were wholly
ignorant of the history of the people to whom they were opposed.
May I be forgiven the observation, that the inquiries
of ... have led me into the belief that some candid and
well-informed English gentlemen of the present day have
almost as little acquaintance with it as had Lord North.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>
<p>Respecting the Revolution itself, the interest of its military
history is such as to fix the attention of the most thoughtless
readers; but in this, foreigners sometimes appear to imagine,
was expended the whole virtue of America. That a country
which could put forth so much energy, magnanimity, and
wisdom, as appeared in that struggle, should suddenly lose a
claim to all these qualities, would be no less surprising than
humiliating. If we glance at the civil history of these republics
since the era of their independence, do we find no
traces of the same character? Were we to consider only
the national institutions, the mild and impartial laws, the
full establishment of the rights of conscience, the multiplication
of schools and colleges to an extent unknown in any
other country of the world, all the improvements in every
branch of internal policy which have placed this people in
their present state of peace and unrivalled prosperity, we
must allow them to be not only wise to their interests, but
alive to the pleas of humanity; but there are not wanting instances
of a yet more liberal policy.</p>

<p>How seldom is it that history affords us the example of a
voluntary sacrifice on the part of separate communities to
further the common good! It appears to me that the short
history of America furnishes us with more examples of this
kind than that of any other nation, ancient or modern.
Throughout the war of the Revolution, and for some years
preceding it, the public feeling may be said to have been unusually
excited. At such times, men, and societies of men,
are equal to actions beyond the strength of their virtue at
cooler moments. Passing on, therefore, to the peace of 1783,
we find a number of independent republics gradually reconciling
their separate and clashing interests, each yielding
something to promote the advantage of all, and sinking the
pride of individual sovereignty in that of the united whole.
The remarks made by Ramsay on the adoption of the federal
constitution are so apposite that I cannot resist quoting them:</p>

<p>“The adoption of this constitution was a triumph of virtue
and good sense over the vices and follies of human nature;
in some respects, the merit of it is greater than that of the<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
Declaration of Independence. The worst of men can be
urged to make a spirited resistance to invasion of their
rights; but higher grades of virtue are requisite to induce
freemen, in the possession of a limited sovereignty, voluntarily
to surrender a portion of their natural liberties; to impose
on themselves those restraints of good government which
bridle the ferocity of man, compel him to respect the claims
of others, and to submit his rights and his wrongs to be decided
upon by the voices of his fellow citizens. The instances
of nations which have vindicated their liberty by
the sword are many; of those which have made a good use of
their liberty when acquired are comparatively few.”</p>

<p>Nor did the liberality of these republics evince itself only
in the adoption of the general government. We find some
making voluntary concessions of vast territories, that they
might be devoted to national purposes; others releasing part
of their own people from existing engagements, and leaving
them to consult their wishes and convenience by forming
themselves into new communities.</p>

<p>Should we contrast this policy with that employed by other
nations, we might hastily pronounce this people to be singularly
free from the ordinary passions of humanity. But, no;
they are only singularly enlightened in the art of government;
they have learned that there is no strength without
union, no union without good fellowship, and no good fellowship
without fair dealing; and, having learned this, they are
only singularly fortunate in being able to reduce their
knowledge to practice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FRANCIS LIEBER</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>In these latter days when the world has been inclined to wonder
whether any good could come out of Prussia, it is interesting to recall
that Francis Lieber, who came to the United States in 1827 in
the vanguard of the German political refugees of the early nineteenth
century, was born in Berlin, March 18, 1800. His life was one of
intense activity, both physical and mental. He fought in the Prussian
army at Ligny and at Waterloo, and was severely wounded in
the attack on Namur. After the Napoleonic wars he studied in Berlin;
and in 1819, because of his political ideas, he was imprisoned on
the charge of plotting against the government. He was discharged
without trial; but, being forbidden to stay at the Prussian universities,
he took his degree at Jena in 1820. After taking part in
the Greek Revolution of 1821 he went to Rome, where he became a
tutor in the family of the famous historian, Niebuhr. On returning
to Berlin he was rearrested and imprisoned, but released
through the efforts of Niebuhr. Tired of this relentless persecution,
he left his native land forever in 1825. Before embarking for
the New World he was a teacher in London for a short time.</p>

<p>Lieber’s first literary undertaking after reaching the United States
was the editing of the Encyclopædia Americana in Boston, 1827-32.
For the next twenty years he was professor of political economy in
South Carolina College, where his most important works were produced,&mdash;“A
Manual of Political Ethics,” 1838; “Legal and Political
Hermeneutics,” 1839; “Civil Liberty and Self-government,” 1852.
In 1856 he was called to a similar professorship in Columbia College,
New York. He was member of the French Institute and other
learned societies in Europe and America.</p>

<p>The spirit of the man and his work is manifested in his favorite
motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullum jus sine officio, nullum officium sine jure</i> (“No right
without its duties, no duty without its rights”). It is not necessary
to mention his numerous writings except the one of immediate interest
here,&mdash;“The Stranger in America,” published in 1834, a series
of letters written to a friend in Germany. In the selection that follows,
the reader will be struck by the wisdom and foresight in pointing
out the danger of segregation and the futility of German immigrants
attempting to erect a German state within the United States.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_34" class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>


<h3>A GERMAN IMMIGRANT POINTS OUT
THE DANGERS OF SEGREGATION</h3>

<p>The Germans, as I said, form a most valuable addition to
our population, when mingled with the great predominant
race inhabiting the northern part of this continent. Whenever
colonists settle among a different nation, in such numbers
and so closely together that they may live on among
themselves, without intermixture with the original inhabitants,
a variety of inconveniences will necessarily arise. Living
in an isolated state, the current of civilization of the
country in which they live does not reach them; and they
are equally cut off from that of their mother country: mental
stagnation is the consequence. They remain a foreign
element, an ill-joined part of the great machinery of which
they still form, and needs must form, a part. Sometimes,
indeed, particular circumstances may alter the view of the
case. When the French Protestant colonists were received
into Prussia, it was perhaps judicious to allow them, for example
in Berlin, to form for a time a community for themselves,
to have their own jurisdiction, schools, and churches,
because they were more perfect in many branches of industry
than the people among whom they settled; and, had they
been obliged to immerge forthwith, their skill, so desirable
to those who received them, might have been lost.</p>

<p>At present, however, they too are immerged in the mass of
the population. Besides, the inconvenience arising from their
forming a separate community was never very great, since
they were few in number, and belonged by their professions
to the better educated classes. But take an example in the
Hussites, who settled in Germany; remember the Bohemian
village near Berlin, called Rixdorf, the inhabitants of which
obstinately refused intermarrying with Germans, and many
of whom, until very recently, continued to speak Bohemian
only. Those, therefore, who lately proposed to form a
whole German state in our west, ought to weigh well their
project before they set about it, if ever it should become<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
possible to put this scheme into practice, which I seriously
doubt. “Ossification,” as the Germans call it, would be the
unavoidable consequence. These colonists would be unable,
though they might come by thousands and tens of thousands,
to develop for themselves German literature, German language,
German law, German science, German art; everything
would remain stationary at the point where it was
when they brought it over from the mother country, and
within less than fifty years our colony would degenerate
into an antiquated, ill-adapted element of our great national
system, with which, sooner or later, it must assimilate.
What a voluntary closing of the eyes to light would it be
for a colony among people of the Anglican race, which, in
point of politics, has left every other race far behind, to
strive to isolate itself!</p>

<p><span id="Page_36" class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>


<h3>POLITICAL LIBERTY IN AMERICA</h3>

<p>As a thousand things co-operated in ancient Greece to produce
that unrivalled state of perfection in which we find the
fine arts to have been there,&mdash;a happy constellation of the
most fortunate stars,&mdash;so a thousand favorable circumstances
concur in America to make it possible that a far greater
amount of liberty can be introduced into all the concerns of
her political society than ever was possible before with any
other nation, or will be at any future period, yet also requiring
its sacrifices, as the fine arts with the Greeks required
theirs.</p>

<p>The influence of this nation has been considerable already;
it will be much more so yet in ages to come; political ideas
will be developed here, and have a decided effect on the
whole European race, and, for aught I know, upon other
races. But as the Grecian art has kindled the sense of the
beautiful with many nations, but never could be equalled
again (as a national affair), so it is possible that political notions,
developed here and received by other nations, will have
a sound influence only if in their new application they are
modified to the given circumstances; for it is not in the power
of any man or nation to create all those circumstances under
the shade of which liberty reposes here. Politics is civil architecture,
and a poor architect indeed is he who forgets three
things in building: the place where the building is to be
raised, the materials with which he has to build, and the object
for which the structure is erected. If the materials are
Jews of Palestine, and if the object of the fabric be to keep
the people as separate from neighbors as possible, the architect
would not obtain his end by a constitution similar to that
of one of our new States.</p>

<p>It was necessary for the Americans, in order to make them
fit to solve certain political problems, which, until their solution
here, were considered chimerical (take as an instance
the keeping of this immense country without a garrison),
that they should descend from the English, should begin as<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
persecuted colonists severed from the mother country, and
yet loving it with all their heart and all their soul; to have
a continent, vast and fertile, and possessing those means of
internal communication which gave to Europe the great superiority
over Asia and Africa; to be at such a distance from
Europe that she should appear as a map; to be mostly Protestants,
and to settle in colonies with different charters, so
that, when royal authority was put down, they were as so
many independent States, and yet to be all of one metal, so
that they never ceased morally to form one nation, nor to
feel as such.</p>

<p>You may say, “Strange, that an abuse of liberty, as this
apparent or real party strife in election contests actually is,
should lead you to the assertion that no nation is fitter for
a government of law.” Yet I do repeat it. How would it
be with other nations? It would be <em>after</em> an election of this
kind that the real trouble would only <em>begin</em>; we see an instance
in South America. Here, on the other hand, as soon
as the election is over, the contest is settled, and the citizen
obeys the law. “Keep to the right, as the law directs,” you
will often find on sign-boards on bridges in this country. It
expresses the authority which the law here possesses. I
doubt very much whether the Romans, noted for their obedience
to the law, held it in higher respect than the Americans.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CARL SCHURZ</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Carl Schurz, probably the most eminent of German immigrants
to the United States, was born in Rhenish Prussia, in 1829. He
came to America in 1852 and settled in Missouri, from which State
he was sent to Congress as Senator. He served as a general in the
Union Army during the Civil War. In 1875 he removed to New
York City and was editor of <cite>The Evening Post</cite> from 1881 to 1884.
He was active in support of civil service reform, and as a political
thinker commanded high respect. His most notable works are his
“Speeches,” his “Reminiscences,” a “Life of Henry Clay,” and “Abraham
Lincoln: an Essay.” The last was originally published in <cite>The
Atlantic Monthly</cite> as a review of “Abraham Lincoln: A History,” by
Nicolay and Hay. As a tribute to the life and work of Lincoln it
is worthy to stand beside the “Commemoration Ode” of Lowell and
the memorial poems of Whitman. Both from his natural sympathies
and endowments and because of his participation in the
events of the time, Schurz was eminently qualified to write on the
subject. With fine enthusiasm and yet avoiding extravagant eulogy,
he never loses sight of the essentially human characteristics of the
great President. The following passage comprises the closing words
of the essay. The selections on “True Americanism” are taken from
an address delivered in Faneuil Hall, Boston, on the 18th of April,
1859.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_39" class="pagenum">[39]</span></p>


<h3>AN IMMIGRANT’S TRIBUTE TO LINCOLN</h3>

<p>To the younger generation Abraham Lincoln has already
become a half-mythical figure, which, in the haze of historic
distance, grows to more and more heroic proportions, but
also loses in distinctness of outline and feature. This is indeed
the common lot of popular heroes; but the Lincoln legend
will be more than ordinarily apt to become fanciful, as
his individuality, assembling seemingly incongruous qualities
and forces in a character at the same time grand and most
lovable, was so unique, and his career so abounding in startling
contrasts. As the state of society in which Abraham
Lincoln grew up passes away, the world will read with increasing
wonder of the man who, not only of the humblest
origin, but remaining the simplest and most unpretending of
citizens, was raised to a position of power unprecedented in
our history; who was the gentlest and most peace-loving of
mortals, unable to see any creature suffer without a pang in
his own breast, and suddenly found himself called to conduct
the greatest and bloodiest of our wars; who wielded
the power of government when stern resolution and relentless
force were the order of the day, and then won and ruled
the popular mind and heart by the tender sympathies of his
nature; who was a cautious conservative by temperament
and mental habit, and led the most sudden and sweeping social
revolution of our time; who, preserving his homely
speech and rustic manner even in the most conspicuous position
of that period, drew upon himself the scoffs of polite
society, and then thrilled the soul of mankind with utterances
of wonderful beauty and grandeur; who, in his heart
the best friend of the defeated South, was murdered because
a crazy fanatic took him for its most cruel enemy; who,
while in power, was beyond measure lampooned and maligned
by sectional passion and an excited party spirit, and
around whose bier friend and foe gathered to praise him&mdash;which
they have since never ceased to do&mdash;as one of the
greatest of Americans and the best of men.</p>

<p><span id="Page_40" class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>


<h3>TRUE AMERICANISM</h3>

<p>It is one of the earliest recollections of my boyhood that
one summer night our whole village was stirred up by an
uncommon occurrence. I say our village, for I was born
not far from the beautiful spot where the Rhine rolls his
green waters out of the wonderful gate of the Seven Mountains,
and then meanders with majestic tranquillity through
one of the most glorious valleys of the world. That night
our neighbors were pressing around a few wagons covered
with linen sheets and loaded with household utensils and
boxes and trunks to their utmost capacity. One of our
neighboring families was moving far away across a great
water, and it was said they would never again return. And
I saw silent tears trickling down weather-beaten cheeks, and
the hands of rough peasants firmly pressing each other, and
some of the men and women hardly able to speak when they
nodded to one another a last farewell. At last the train
started into motion, they gave three cheers for <em>America</em>,
and then in the first gray dawn of the morning I saw them
wending their way over the hill until they disappeared in the
shadow of the forest. And I heard many a man say, how
happy he would be if he could go with them to that great
and free country, where a man could be himself.</p>

<p>That was the first time that I heard of America, and my
childish imagination took possession of a land covered partly
with majestic trees, partly with flowery prairies, immeasurable
to the eye, and intersected with large rivers and broad
lakes,&mdash;a land where everybody could do what he thought
best, and where nobody need be poor because everybody was
free.</p>

<p>And later, when I was old enough to read, and descriptions
of this country and books on American history fell into
my hands, the offspring of my imagination acquired the colors
of reality, and I began to exercise my brain with the
thought what man might be and become when left perfectly
free to himself. And still later, when ripening into manhood,<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
I looked up from my schoolbooks into the stir and bustle
of the world, and the trumpet-tones of struggling humanity
struck my ear and thrilled my heart, and I saw my nation
shake her chains in order to burst them, and I heard
a gigantic, universal shout for Liberty rising up to the skies;
and at last, after having struggled manfully and drenched
the earth of Fatherland with the blood of thousands of noble
beings, I saw that nation crushed down again, not only
by overwhelming armies, but by the dead weight of customs
and institutions and notions and prejudices, which past centuries
had heaped upon them, and which a moment of enthusiasm,
however sublime, could not destroy; then I consoled
an almost despondent heart with the idea of a youthful
people and of original institutions clearing the way for an
untrammeled development of the ideal nature of man. Then
I turned my eyes instinctively across the Atlantic Ocean, and
America and Americanism, as I fancied them, appeared to
me as the last depositories of the hopes of all true friends of
humanity.</p>

<p>I say all this, not as though I indulged in the presumptuous
delusion that my personal feelings and experience
would be of any interest to you, but in order to show you
what America is to the thousands of thinking men in the
old world, who, disappointed in their fondest hopes and depressed
by the saddest experience, cling with their last remnant
of confidence in human nature, to the last spot on
earth where man is free to follow the road to attainable
perfection, and where, unbiased by the disastrous influence
of traditional notions, customs, and institutions, he acts on
his own responsibility. They ask themselves: Was it but a
wild delusion when we thought that man has the faculty to
be free and to govern himself? Have we been fighting, were
we ready to die, for a mere phantom, for a mere product
of a morbid imagination? This question downtrodden humanity
cries out into the world, and from this country it
expects an answer....</p>

<p>They speak of the greatness of the Roman Republic! Oh,
sir, if I could call the proudest of Romans from his grave, I<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
would take him by the hand and say to him, Look at this
picture, and at this! The greatness of the Roman Republic
consisted in its despotic rule over the world; the greatness of the
American Republic consists in the secured right of man to
govern himself. The dignity of the Roman citizen consisted
in his exclusive privileges; the dignity of the American citizen
consists in his holding the natural rights of his neighbor
just as sacred as his own. The Roman Republic recognized
and protected the <em>rights of the citizen</em>, at the same
time disregarding and leaving unprotected the <em>rights of man</em>;
Roman citizenship was founded upon monopoly, not upon
the claims of human nature. What the citizen of Rome
claimed for himself, he did not respect in others; his own
greatness was his only object; his own liberty, as he regarded
it, gave him the privilege to oppress his fellow-beings. His
democracy, instead of elevating mankind to its own level,
trampled the rights of man into the dust. The security of
the Roman Republic, therefore, consisted in the power of
the sword; the security of the American Republic rests in the
equality of human rights! The Roman Republic perished by
the sword; the American Republic will stand as long as the
equality of human rights remains inviolate. Which of the
two Republics is the greater&mdash;the Republic of the Roman, or
the Republic of <em>man</em>?</p>

<p>Sir, I wish the words of the Declaration of Independence,
“that all men are created free and equal, and are endowed
with certain inalienable rights,” were inscribed upon every
gatepost within the limits of this Republic. From
this principle the Revolutionary Fathers derived their claim
to independence; upon this they founded the institutions of
this country, and the whole structure was to be the living
incarnation of this idea. This principle contains the programme
of our political existence. It is the most progressive,
and at the same time the most conservative one; the most
progressive, for it takes even the lowliest members of the
human family out of their degradation, and inspires them
with the elevating consciousness of equal human dignity; the
most conservative, for it makes a common cause of individual<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
rights. From the equality of rights springs identity of our
highest interests; you cannot subvert your neighbor’s rights
without striking a dangerous blow at your own. And when
the rights of one cannot be infringed without finding a ready
defence in all others who defend their own rights in defending
his, then, and only then, are the rights of all safe
against the usurpation of governmental authority.</p>

<p>This general identity of interests is the only thing that
can guarantee the stability of democratic institutions.
Equality of rights, embodied in general self-government, is
the great moral element of true democracy; it is the only
reliable safety-valve in the machinery of modern society.
There is the solid foundation of our system of government;
there is our mission; there is our greatness; there is our
safety; there, and nowhere else! This is true Americanism,
and to this I pay the tribute of my devotion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDWIN LAWRENCE GODKIN</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Edwin Lawrence Godkin was born of English ancestry at Moyne,
County Wicklow, Ireland, on October 2, 1831. His father, the Rev.
James Godkin, a Presbyterian minister of literary talents, after being
forced from his pulpit for espousing the cause of Young Ireland,
became a journalist of some distinction. The son received his preparatory
education at Armagh, and at Silcoates School, Wakefield,
Yorkshire. In 1846 he entered Queen’s College, Belfast. After graduating
from this institution in 1851, he went to London to study law
at Lincoln’s Inn. After some journalistic experience in the Crimea
and in Belfast, he came to America in 1856 and settled in New
York. His real career began with the founding of <cite>The New York
Nation</cite> in 1865. His connection with this journal was both long and
distinguished, and his efforts for the encouragement of a sound and
enlightened public opinion have recently been appropriately recognized
in the semi-centenary volume, “Fifty Years of American
Idealism,” edited by Gustav Pollak. He contributed many incisive
essays on political and economic subjects to various magazines. The
most important of these have been collected in three volumes, “Reflections
and Comments,” “Problems of Modern Democracy,” and “Unforeseen
Tendencies of Democracy.” It is from the opening essay of
the second that the following selection is taken.</p>

<p>Wendell Phillips Garrison, his associate, said of him: “As no
American could have written Bryce’s ‘American Commonwealth’ or
Goldwin Smith’s ‘History of the United States,’ so it may be doubted
if any native of this country could have erected the standard of
political independence which Mr. Godkin set up in <cite>The Nation</cite> and
maintained in <cite>The Evening Post</cite>. He did this, however, not as a
foreigner, but as an American to the core. A utilitarian of the
school of Bentham, an economist of the school of John Stuart Mill,
an English Liberal to whom America, with all its flagrant inconsistency
of slaveholding, was still the hope of universal democracy,
he cast in his lot with us, became a naturalized citizen, took an
American wife&mdash;gave every pledge to the land of his adoption except
that of being a servile follower of party.” Brilliant, thoughtful,
questioning, he was keenly sensible of the many evil tendencies
in modern democracy; yet with philosophic insight he rejected the
unsound comparisons drawn by many political thinkers between
ancient aristocratic democracies and modern democracy, which he
viewed as a new experiment and therefore to be tested by new
principles and new conditions.</p></div>

<h3>AN IMMIGRANT’S FAITH IN DEMOCRACY<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h3>

<p>If, indeed, the defects which foreign observers see, and
many of which Americans acknowledge and deplore, in the
politics and society of the United States were fairly chargeable
to democracy,&mdash;if “the principle of equality” were necessarily
fatal to excellence in the arts, to finish in literature,
to simplicity and force in oratory, to fruitful exploration in
the fields of science, to statesmanship in the government, to
discipline in the army, to grace and dignity in social intercourse,
to subordination to lawful authority, and to self-restraint
in the various relations of life,&mdash;the future of the
world would be such as no friend of the race would wish to
contemplate; for the spread of democracy is on all sides
acknowledged to be irresistible. Even those who watch its
advance with most fear and foreboding confess that most
civilized nations must erelong succumb to its sway. Its
progress in some countries may be slower than in others, but
it is constant in all; and it is accelerated by two powerful
agencies,&mdash;the Christian religion and the study of political
economy.</p>

<p>The Christian doctrine that men, however unequal in
their condition or in their gifts on earth, are of equal value
in the eyes of their Creator, and are entitled to respect and
consideration, if for no other reason, for the simple one that
they are human souls, long as it has been preached, has,
strange to say, only very lately begun to exercise any perceptible
influence on politics. It led a troubled and precarious
life for nearly eighteen hundred years in conventicles
and debating clubs, in the romance of poets, in the
dreams of philosophers and the schemes of philanthropists.
But it is now found in the cabinets of kings and statesmen,
on the floor of parliament houses, and in the most secret
of diplomatic conferences. It gives shape and foundation<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
to nearly every great social reform, and its voice is heard
above the roar of every revolution.</p>

<p>And it derives invaluable aid in keeping its place and extending
its influence in national councils from the rapid
spread of the study of political economy, a science which is
based on the assumption that men are free and independent.
There is hardly one of its principles which is applicable to
any state of society in which each individual is not master of
his own actions and sole guardian of his own welfare. In a
community in which the relations of its members are regulated
by status and not by contract, it has no place and no
value. The natural result of the study and discussion which
the ablest thinkers have expended on it during the last
eighty years has been to place before the civilized world in
the strongest light the prodigious impulse which is given to
human energy and forethought and industry, and the great
gain to society at large, by the recognition in legislation of
the capacity, as well as of the right, of each human being
to seek his own happiness in his own way. Of course no
political system in which this principle has a place can long
avoid conceding to all who live under it equality before the
law; and from equality before the law to the possession of an
equal share in the making of the laws, there is, as everybody
must see who is familiar with modern history, but a
very short step.</p>

<p>If this spread of democracy, however, was sure, as its enemies
maintain, to render great attainments and great excellence
impossible or rare, to make literary men slovenly
and inaccurate and tasteless, artists mediocre, professors of
science dull and unenterprising, and statesmen conscienceless
and ignorant, it would threaten civilization with such
danger that no friend of progress could wish to see it. But
it is difficult to discover on what it is, either in history or
human nature, that this apprehension is founded. M. de
Tocqueville and all his followers take it for granted that the
great incentive to excellence, in all countries in which excellence
is found, is the patronage and encouragement of an
aristocracy; that democracy is generally content with mediocrity.<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
But where is the proof of this? The incentive to
exertion which is widest, most constant, and most powerful
in its operation in all civilized countries, is the desire of
distinction; and this may be composed either of love of fame
or love of wealth, or of both. In literary and artistic and
scientific pursuits, sometimes the strongest influence is exerted
by a love of the subject. But it may be safely said that
no man has ever yet labored in any of the higher callings to
whom the applause and appreciation of his fellows was not
one of the sweetest rewards of his exertions. There is probably
not a masterpiece in existence, either in literature or in
art, probably few discoveries in science have ever been made,
which we do not owe in a large measure to the love of distinction.
Who paints pictures, or has ever painted them,
that they may delight no eye but his own? Who writes
books for the mere pleasure of seeing his thoughts on paper?
Who discovers or invents, and is willing, provided the
world is the better of his discoveries or inventions, that another
should enjoy the honor? Fame has, in short, been in
all ages and in all countries recognized as one of the strongest
springs of human action&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“The spur that doth the clear spirit raise
</div><div class="indent0">To scorn delight and live laborious days,&mdash;”
</div></div></div></div>


<p>sweetening toil, robbing danger and poverty and even death
itself of their terrors.</p>

<p>What is there, we would ask, in the nature of democratic
institutions, that should render this great spring of action
powerless, that should deprive glory of all radiance, and put
ambition to sleep? Is it not notorious, on the contrary,
that one of the most marked peculiarities of democratic society,
or of a society drifting toward democracy, is the fire of
competition which rages in it, the fevered anxiety which
possesses all its members to rise above the dead level to
which the law is ever seeking to confine them, and by some
brilliant stroke become something higher and more remarkable
than their fellows? The secret of that great restlessness,<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
which is one of the most disagreeable accompaniments
of life in democratic countries, is in fact due to the eagerness
of everybody to grasp the prizes of which in aristocratic
countries only the few have much chance. And in no other
society is success more worshipped, is distinction of any kind
more widely flattered and caressed. Where is the successful
author, or artist, or discoverer, the subject of greater homage
than in France or America? And yet in both the principle
of equality reigns supreme; and his advancement in the
social scale has gone on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</i> in every country with the
spread of democratic ideas and manners. Grub Street was
the author’s retreat in the aristocratic age; in this democratic
one, he is welcome at the King’s table, and sits at the
national council board. In democratic societies, in fact, excellence
is the first title to distinction; in aristocratic ones,
there are two or three others which are far stronger, and
which must be stronger, or aristocracy could not exist. The
moment you acknowledge that the highest social position
ought to be the reward of the man who has the most talent,
you make aristocratic institutions impossible. But to make
the thirst for distinction lose its power over the human heart,
you must do something more than establish equality of conditions;
you must recast human nature itself....</p>

<p>There are some, however, who, while acknowledging that
the love of distinction will retain its force under every form
of social or political organization, yet maintain that to excel
in the arts, science, or literature requires leisure, and the possession
of leisure implies the possession of fortune. This men
in a democratic society cannot have, because the absence of
great hereditary wealth is necessary to the perpetuation of
democracy. Every man, or nearly every man, must toil for a
living; and therefore it becomes impossible for him to gratify
the thirst for distinction, let him feel it ever so strongly. The
attention he can give to literature or art or science must be
too desultory and hasty, his mental training too defective, to
allow him to work out valuable results or conduct important
researches. To achieve great things in these fields, it is said
and insinuated, men must be elevated, by the possession of<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
fortune, above the vulgar, petty cares of life; their material
wants must be provided for before they concentrate their
thoughts with the requisite intensity on the task before them.
Therefore it is to aristocracy we must look for any great advance
in these pursuits.</p>

<p>The history of literature and art and philosophy is, however,
very far from lending confirmation to this opinion. If
it teaches us anything, it teaches us that the possession of
leisure, far from having helped men in the pursuit of knowledge,
seems to have impeded them. Those who have pursued
it most successfully are all but invariably those who
have pursued it under difficulties. The possession of great
wealth no doubt gives facilities for study and cultivation
which the mass of mankind do not possess; but it at the
same time exerts an influence on the character which, in a
vast majority of cases, renders the owner unwilling to avail
himself of them. We owe to the Roman aristocracy the
great fabric of Roman jurisprudence; but, since their time,
what has any aristocracy done for art and literature, or law?
They have for over a thousand years been in possession of
nearly the whole resources of every country in Europe. They
have had its wealth, its libraries, its archives, its teachers, at
their disposal; and yet was there ever a more pitiful record
than the list of “Royal and Noble Authors.” One can hardly
help being astonished, too, at the smallness and paltriness of
the legacies which the aristocracy of the aristocratic age has
bequeathed to this democratic age which is succeeding it. It
has, indeed, handed down to us many glorious traditions,
many noble and inspiring examples of courage and fortitude
and generosity. The democratic world would certainly be
worse off than it is if it never heard of the Cid, or Bayard,
or Du Guesclin, of Montrose, or Hampden, or Russell. But
what has it left behind it for which the lover of art may be
thankful, by which literature has been made richer, philosophy
more potent or more fruitful? The painting and sculpture
of modern Europe owe not only their glory, but their
very existence, to the labors of poor and obscure men. The
great architectural monuments by which its soil is covered<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
were hardly any of them the product of aristocratic feeling
or liberality. If we except a few palaces and a few fortresses,
we owe nearly all of them to the labor or the genius
or the piety of the democratic cities which grew up in the
midst of feudalism. If we take away the sum total of the
monuments of Continental art all that was created by the
Italian republics, the commercial towns of Germany and
Flanders, and the communes of France, and by the unaided
efforts of the illustrious obscure, the remainder would form a
result poor and pitiful indeed. We may say much the same
thing of every great work in literature, and every great discovery
in science. Few of them have been produced by men
of leisure, nearly all by those whose life was a long struggle
to escape from the vulgarest and most sordid cares. And
what is perhaps most remarkable of all is, that the Catholic
Church, the greatest triumph of organizing genius, the most
impressive example of the power of combination and of discipline
which the world has ever seen, was built up and has
been maintained by the labors of men drawn from the humblest
ranks of society.</p>

<p>Aristocracy applied itself exclusively for ages to the profession
of arms. If there was anything at which it might
have seemed hopeless for democracy to compete with it, it
was in the raising, framing and handling of armies. But
the very first time that a democratic society found itself compelled
to wage war in defence of its own ideas, it displayed
a force, an originality, a vigor and rapidity of conception, in
this, to it, new pursuit, which speedily laid Europe at its
feet. And the great master of the art of war, be it ever
remembered, was born in obscurity and bred in poverty.</p>

<p>Nor, long as men of leisure have devoted themselves to
the art of government, have they made any contributions
worth mentioning to political science. They have displayed,
indeed, consummate skill and tenacity in pursuing any line
of policy on which they have once deliberately fixed; but all
the great political reforms have been, though often carried
into effect by aristocracies, conceived, agitated, and forced on
the acceptance of the government by the middle and lower<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
classes. The idea of equality before the law was originated
in France by literary men. In England, the slave-trade was
abolished by the labors of the middle classes. The measure
met with the most vigorous opposition in the House of Lords.
The emancipation of the negroes, Catholic emancipation,
Parliamentary reform, law reform, especially the reform in
the criminal law, free trade, and, in fact, nearly every
change which has had for its object the increase of national
happiness and prosperity, has been conceived by men of low
degree, and discussed and forced on the upper classes by men
busy about many other things.</p>

<p>We are, however, very far from believing that democratic
society has no dangers or defects. What we have been endeavoring
to show is that the inquiry into their nature and
number has been greatly impeded by the natural disposition
of foreign observers to take the United States as a fair
specimen of what democracy is under the most favorable circumstances.
The enormous extent of unoccupied land at
our disposal, which raises every man in the community
above want, by affording a ready outlet for surplus population,
is constantly spoken of as a condition wholly favorable
to the democratic experiment,&mdash;more favorable than could
possibly offer itself elsewhere. In so far as it contributes to
the general happiness and comfort, it no doubt makes the
work of government easy; but what we think no political
philosopher ought to forget is that it also offers serious obstacles
to the settlement of a new society on a firm basis,
and produces a certain appearance of confusion and instability,
both in manners and ideas, which unfit it to furnish a
basis for any inductions of much value as to the tendencies
to defects either of an equality of conditions or of democratic
institutions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JOHN BOYLE O’REILLY</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The extremely romantic life of John Boyle O’Reilly began on June
28th, 1844, at Dowth Castle, near the town of Drogheda in Ireland.
His chivalrous nature and passionate love of country and of liberty
were stimulated by the traditions and beauty of the surroundings
and by the atmosphere of legend and story in which he was brought
up by his schoolmaster father and clever and gifted mother. As a
young man he was employed as a compositor in a printing office in
Ireland and later at Preston in Lancashire. In consequence of his
connection with the Fenian movement he was banished to Australia,
whence he escaped to America in 1869, settling in Boston, where his
ability as poet, journalist and orator was quickly recognized.
Maurice Francis Egan has said of him: “In the United States,
after adventures by sea and land, and tortures and suffering borne
with a heroism that was both Greek and Christian, he found the
spirit of freedom in concrete form. Our country satisfied his aspirations
for liberty; he loved Ireland not less, but America more; he
was exiled from the land of his birth, yet he found ample consolation
in the country he had chosen.”</p>

<p>The life of the poet by James Jeffrey Roche, together with his
complete poems and speeches, edited by Mrs. O’Reilly, was published
by Cassell in 1891. A volume of selected poems was published by
Kenedy in 1913.</p></div>

<h2 class="nobreak">HANS MATTSON</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hans Mattson was the son of an independent freeholder and successful
farmer of the parish of Onnestad, near the city of Kristianstad,
Sweden. In an unpretending little cabin built by his father
he spent the first years of his happy and peaceful childhood. On
one occasion he was taken by his parents to see the king, who was
to pass by on the highway near his home. In the midst of the confusion
he did succeed in getting a glimpse of King Oscar I. In
his childish mind he had fancied that the king and his family and
all others in authority were the peculiar and elect people of the
Almighty, but after this event he began to entertain serious doubts
as to the correctness of his views on this matter.</p>

<p>After a year and a half in the Swedish army he decided to leave
the service and try his luck “in a country where inherited names
and titles were not the necessary conditions of success.” He says:
“At that time America was little known in our part of the country,
only a few persons having emigrated from the whole district. But
we knew that it was a new country, inhabited by a free and independent
people, that it had a liberal government and great natural
resources, and these inducements were sufficient for us.”</p>

<p>From the time of his arrival at Boston until his final settling in
Minnesota, his career is but typical of that of the many sturdy and
enterprising pioneers of Scandinavian origin who have contributed
so much to the building of the Northwest. He served as a colonel
in the Civil War, and in 1869 was elected as Secretary of State in
Minnesota. Later he was Consul General of the United States in
India.</p>

<p>The selection that follows is taken from the final chapter of his
“Reminiscences,” the English translation of which was published in
1892.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_59" class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>


<h3>SCANDINAVIAN CONTRIBUTION TO
AMERICAN NATIONALITY</h3>

<p>It is a great mistake which some make, to think that it is
only for their brawn and muscle that the Northmen have
become a valuable acquisition to the American population;
on the contrary, they have done, and are doing, as much as
any other nationality within the domain of mind and heart.
Not to speak of the early discovery of America by the Scandinavians
four hundred years before the time of Columbus,
they can look back with proud satisfaction on the part they
have taken in all respects to make this great republic what it
is to-day.</p>

<p>The early Swedish colonists in Delaware, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey worked as hard for liberty and independence
as the English did in New England and in the South.
There were no tories among them, and when the Continental
Congress stood wavering equal in the balance for and against
the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, it was a
Swede, John Morton (Mortenson), of the old Delaware
stock, who gave the casting vote of Pennsylvania in favor of
the sacred document.</p>

<p>When, nearly a century later, the great rebellion burst
upon the land, a gallant descendant of the Swedes, Gen.
Robert Anderson, met its first shock at Fort Sumter, and,
during the bitter struggle of four years which followed, the
Scandinavian-Americans were as true and loyal to their
adopted country as their native-born neighbors, giving their
unanimous support to the cause of the Union and fighting
valiantly for it. Nor should it be forgotten that it was the
Swede, John Ericsson, who, by his inventive genius, saved
the navy and the great seaports of the United States, and
that it was another Swede by descent, Admiral Dahlgren,
who furnished the model for the best guns of our artillery.
Surely love of freedom, valor, genius, patriotism and religious
fervor was not planted in America by the seeds brought
over in the Mayflower alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>Yes, it is verily true that the Scandinavian immigrants,
from the early colonists of 1638 to the present time, have
furnished strong hands, clear heads and loyal hearts to the
republic. They have caused the wilderness to blossom like
the rose; they have planted schools and churches on the hills
and in the valleys; they have honestly and ably administered
the public affairs of town, county and state; they have
helped to make wise laws for their respective commonwealths
and in the halls of Congress; they have, with honor
and ability, represented their adopted country abroad; they
have sanctified the American soil by their blood, shed in
freedom’s cause on the battle-fields of the Revolution and the
Civil War; and, though proud of their Scandinavian ancestry,
they love America and American institutions as deeply
and as truly as do the descendants of the Pilgrims, the starry
emblem of liberty meaning as much to them as to any other
citizen.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Scandinavian-American feels a certain
sense of ownership in the glorious heritage of American soil,
with its rivers, lakes, mountains, valleys, woods and prairies,
and in all its noble institutions; and he feels that the blessings
which he enjoys are not his by favor or sufferance, but
by right;&mdash;by moral as well as civil right. For he took possession
of the wilderness, endured the hardships of the pioneer,
contributed his full share toward the grand results accomplished,
and is in mind and heart a true and loyal American
citizen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JACOB RIIS</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jacob Riis, who may well stand as a representative of the best
that America has received from the Scandinavian countries, was
born at Ribe, Denmark, May 3, 1849. He emigrated to the United
States in 1870, where he subsequently obtained a position as reporter
on <cite>The New York Tribune</cite> and <cite>The Evening Sun</cite>. It is at the close
of his well-known autobiography that he relates how he came to a
realization that he was indeed an American in heart as well as in
name. In words of patriotic fervor he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have told the story of the making of an American. There remains
to tell how I found out that he was made and finished at
last. It was when I went back to see my mother once more and,
wandering about the country of my childhood’s memories, had come
to the city of Elsinore. There I fell ill of a fever and lay many
weeks in the house of a friend upon the shore of the beautiful
Oeresund. One day when the fever had left me, they rolled my bed
into a room overlooking the sea. The sunlight danced upon the
waves, and the distant mountains of Sweden were blue against the
horizon. Ships passed under full sail up and down the great waterway
of the nations. But the sunshine and the peaceful day bore no
message to me. I lay moodily picking at the coverlet, sick and discouraged
and sore&mdash;I hardly knew why myself. Until all at once
there sailed past, close inshore, a ship flying at the top the flag of
freedom, blown out on the breeze till every star in it shone bright
and clear. That moment I knew. Gone were illness, discouragement,
and gloom! Forgotten weakness and suffering, the cautions
of doctor and nurse. I sat up in bed and shouted, laughed and
cried by turns, waving my handkerchief to the flag out there. They
thought I had lost my head, but I told them no, thank God! I had
found it, and my heart, too, at last. I knew then that it was my
flag; that my children’s home was mine, indeed; that I also had
become an American in truth. And I thanked God, and, like unto
the man sick of the palsy, arose from my bed and went home,
healed.”</p>

<p>Besides being the author of several books, such as “The Battle
with the Slum,” “How the Other Half Lives,” and “The Children of
the Poor,” dealing with the life of the people of New York’s East
Side, he was an active and practical reformer. In the course of his
struggles to ameliorate the condition of the poor, he met Theodore
Roosevelt and formed the friendship which inspired the volume
represented in the following selection. Riis and Roosevelt had much
in common. There was in both a great deal of the old Anglo-Saxon
fighting spirit, ennobled by modern influences and employed in defense<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
of right and justice. Their mutual and steadfast devotion to
each other resembled that of ancient liegeman and lord. This hero-worship
is, after all, not unique in our history. It should be a cause
for great pride that so many of our leaders, of whom, of course,
Lincoln is the most striking example, by embodying the noblest and
the best in American life, have been the living ideal of countless
immigrants.</p></div>

<h3>A YOUNG MAN’S HERO: AN IMMIGRANT’S
TRIBUTE TO ROOSEVELT</h3>

<p>There was never a day that called so loudly for such as he,
as does this of ours. Not that it is worse than other days; I
know it is better. I find proof of it in the very fact that it
is as if the age-long fight between good and evil had suddenly
come to a head, as if all the questions of right, of justice, of
the brotherhood, which we had seen in glimpses before, and
dimly, had all at once come out in the open, craving solution
one and all. A battle royal, truly! A battle for the man of
clean hands and clean mind, who can think straight and act
square; the man who will stand for the right “because it is
right”; who can say, and mean it, that “it is hard to fail, but
worse never to have tried to succeed.” A battle for him who
strives for “that highest form of success which comes, not
to the man who desires mere easy peace, but to him who
does not shrink from danger, from hardship or from bitter
toil, and who out of these wins the splendid ultimate
triumph.” I am but quoting his own words, and never, I
think, did I hear finer than those he spoke of Governor Taft
when he had put by his own preferences and gone to his hard
and toilsome task in the Philippines; for the whole royal,
fighting soul of the man was in them.</p>

<p>“But he undertook it gladly,” he said, “and he is to be
considered thrice fortunate; for in this world the one thing
supremely worth having is the opportunity coupled with the
capacity to do well and worthily a piece of work the doing of
which is of vital consequence to the welfare of mankind.”</p>

<p>There is his measure. Let now the understrappers sputter.
With that for our young men to grow up to, we need
have no fear for the morrow. Let it ask what questions it
will of the Republic, it shall answer them, for we shall have
men at the oars.</p>

<p>This afternoon the newspaper that came to my desk contained
a cable despatch which gave me a glow at the heart<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
such as I have not felt for a while. Just three lines; but
they told that a nation’s conscience was struggling victoriously
through hate and foul play and treason: Captain Dreyfus
was to get a fair trial. Justice was to be done at last to a
once despised Jew whose wrongs had held the civilized world
upon the rack; and the world was made happy. Say now it
does not move! It does, where there are men to move it,&mdash;I
said it before: men who believe in the right and are willing
to fight for it. When the children of poverty and want
came to Mulberry Street for justice, and I knew they came
because Roosevelt had been there, I saw in that what the
resolute, courageous, unyielding determination of one man to
see right done in his own time could accomplish. I have
watched him since in the Navy Department, in camp, as Governor,
in the White House, and more and more I have
made out his message as being to the young men of our day,
himself the youngest of our Presidents. I know it is so, for
when I speak to the young about him, I see their eyes kindle,
and their handshake tells me that they want to be like him,
and are going to try. And then I feel that I, too, have done
something worth doing for my people. For, whether for
good or for evil, we all leave our mark upon our day, and
his is that of a clean, strong man who fights for the right
<em>and wins</em>.</p>

<p>Now, then, a word to these young men who, all over our
broad land, are striving up toward the standard he sets, for
he is their hero by right, as he is mine. Do not be afraid to
own it. The struggle to which you are born, and in which
you are bound to take a hand if you would be men in more
than name, is the struggle between the ideal and the husk;
for life without ideals is like the world without the hope of
heaven, an empty, meaningless husk. It is your business to
read its meaning into it by making the ideals real. The material
things of life are good in their day, but they pass away;
the moral remain to bear witness that the high hopes of
youth are not mere phantasms. Theodore Roosevelt <em>lives
his ideals</em>; therefore you can trust them. Here they are in
working shape: “Face the facts as you find them; strive<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
steadily for the best.” “Be never content with less than the
possible best, and never throw away the possible best because
it is not the ideal best.” Maxims, those, for the young man
who wants to make the most of himself and his time. Happily
for the world, the young man who does not is rare.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">JACOB VAN DER ZEE</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Hollanders of Iowa,” by Jacob Van der Zee, was published
at Iowa City in 1912 by the State Historical Society of Iowa. The
following facts regarding the author and his book are given in the
introduction of the editor, Mr. Benjamin F. Shambaugh:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The author of this volume on ‘The Hollanders of Iowa’ was
admirably fitted for the task. Born of Dutch parents in The
Netherlands and reared among kinsfolk in Iowa, he has been a part
of the life which is portrayed in these pages. At the same time Mr.
Van der Zee’s education at The State University of Iowa, his three
years’ residence at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, and his research
work in The State Historical Society of Iowa have made it possible
for him to study the Hollanders objectively as well as subjectively.
Accordingly, his book is in no respect an overdrawn, eulogistic account
of the Dutch people.</p>

<p>“The history of the Hollanders of Iowa is not wholly provincial:
it suggests much that is typical in the development of Iowa and in
the larger history of the West: it is ‘a story of the stubborn and unyielding
fight of men and women who overcame the obstacles of a
new country and handed down to their descendants thriving farms
and homes of peace and plenty.’”</p>

<p>The selection here given comprises chapter four of the book.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_67" class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>


<h3>WHY DUTCH EMIGRANTS TURNED TO
AMERICA</h3>

<p>Such was the condition of things in The Netherlands that
thousands of people lived from hand to mouth, the prey of
poverty and hunger, stupefied by the hopelessness of securing
the necessities of life, and barely enabled through the gifts of
the well-to-do to drag out their wretched lives. At the same
time many of these unfortunate persons were hopeful and
eager to find a place where they might obtain a livelihood,
lead quiet lives of honesty and godliness, and educate their
children in the principles of religion without let or hindrance.
The leaders of the Separatists looked forward to a life of
freedom in a land where man would not have to wait for
work, but where work awaited man, where people would not
rub elbows by reason of the density of population, and
where God’s creation would welcome the coming of man.</p>

<p>When social forces such as these, mostly beyond human
control, began to operate with increasing power, the Dutch
people were not slow to recognize the truth that emigration
was absolutely necessary. The seriousness of the situation
dawned upon all thinking men,&mdash;especially upon state officials,
who feared that unless the stream of emigration could
be directed toward the Dutch colonies, their country would
suffer an enormous drain of capital and human lives. Accordingly
the attention of prospective emigrants was called to the
Dutch East Indies,&mdash;chiefly to the advantages of the rich
island of Java, “that paradise of the world, the pearl in Holland’s
crown.”</p>

<p>The religion of the Dissenters, however, was responsible
for turning the balance in favor of some other land. To
them Java was a closed door. Beside the fear of an unhealthful
climate towered the certainty of legislation hostile to their
Christian principles and ideals. Moreover, could poor men
afford the expense of transportation thither, and could they
feel assured of getting land or work in Java? State officials,
men of learning, and men of business from several parts of<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
the country were summoned to an important conference
at Amsterdam to discuss the whole emigration movement.
The Separatist leaders were asked why they
should not remain Netherlanders under the House of Orange
by removing to the colonies just as the people of the British
Isles found homes in the English colonies. Two Separatist
ministers appealed to the government to direct the flood of
emigration toward Java by promises of civil and religious
liberty. But the attempt to secure a free Christian colony in
Java produced only idle expectations.</p>

<p>Then it was that the people turned their eyes away from
the East toward the United States of North America,&mdash;a
land of freedom and rich blessings, where they hoped to find
in its unsettled interior some spot adaptable to agriculture,
and thus rescue themselves from the miseries of a decadent
state. To the discontented, ambitious Hollander was presented
the picture of a real land of promise, where all things
would smile at him and be prepared, as it were, to aid him.
It was said that “after an ocean passage of trifling expense
the Netherlander may find work to do as soon as he sets foot
on shore; he may buy land for a few florins per acre; and
feel secure and free among a people of Dutch, German and
English birth, who will rejoice to see him come to increase
the nation’s wealth.” Asserting that they could vouch for
the truthfulness of this picture, as based on the positive assurances
and experiences of friends already in America, the Separatist
clergyman-pamphleteers openly declared that they
would not hesitate to rob Holland of her best citizens by
helping them on their way to America.</p>

<p>Of the people and government of the United States,
Scholte, who was destined to lead hundreds of his countrymen
to the State of Iowa, at an early date cherished a highly
favorable opinion, which he expressed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am convinced that a settlement in some healthful region
there will have, by the ordinary blessing of God, excellent
temporal and moral results, especially for the rising generation....
Should it then excite much wonder that I have
firmly resolved to leave The Netherlands and together with<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
so many Christian relatives adopt the United States as a new
fatherland?</p>

<p>“There I shall certainly meet with the same wickedness
which troubles me here; yet I shall find also opportunity to
work. There I shall certainly find the same, if not still
greater, evidence of unbelief and superstition; but I shall
also find a constitutional provision which does not bind my
hands in the use of the Sword of the Spirit, which is the
Word of God; there I can fight for what I believe without
being disobedient to the magistrates and authorities ordained
by God. There I shall find among men the same zeal to obtain
this world’s goods; but I shall not find the same impulse
to get the better of one another, for competition is open to
all; I shall not find the same desire to reduce the wages of
labor, nor the same inducement to avoid taxation, nor the
same peevishness and groaning about the burden of taxation.</p>

<p>“There I shall find no Minister of Public Worship, for the
separation of Church and State is a fact. There I shall not
need to contribute to the support of pastors whose teachings I
abhor. I shall find no school commissions nor school supervisors
who prohibit the use of the Bible in schools and hinder
the organization of special schools, for education is really
free. I shall find there the descendants of earlier inhabitants
of Holland, among whom the piety of our forefathers still
lives, and who are now prepared to give advice and aid to
Hollanders who are forced to come to them.”</p>

<p>Scholte, however, never claimed to be a refugee from the
oppression of the Old World. He left Europe because the
social, religious, and political condition of his native country
was such that, according to his conviction, he could not with
any reasonable hope of success work for the actual benefit of
honest and industrious fellow-men. Very many members of
Scholte’s emigrant association felt certain that they and their
children would sink from the middle class and end their lives
as paupers, if they remained in Holland.</p>

<p>Later emigration to America was in no small degree due to
a cause which has always operated in inducing people to
abandon their European homes. After a period of residence<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
in America, Hollanders, elated by reason of their prosperity
and general change of fortune, very naturally reported their
delight to friends and relatives in the fatherland, strongly
urging them to come and share their good luck instead of
suffering from want in Holland. They wrote of higher
wages, fertile soil, cheapness of the necessities of life, abundance
of cheap land, and many other advantages. If one’s
wages for a day’s work in America equalled a week’s earnings
in Holland, surely it was worth while to leave that unfortunate
country. Such favorable reports as these were
largely instrumental in turning the attention of Hollanders
to the New World as the one great land of opportunity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDWARD BOK</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although it was impossible to include in this volume selections
from “The Americanization of Edward Bok,” recently published, it
seems that some mention should be made of this delightfully reminiscent
autobiography and of its author, who came to this country in
1870 as a little Dutch boy of six years.</p>

<p>There are entertaining chapters on his passion for collecting
autographs from famous people, on his visit to Boston and Cambridge
to see Holmes and Longfellow and Emerson, on his relations
with prominent statesmen and other notable men of his time, and on
his experiences as editor of an influential and successful magazine;
but most pertinent to the purpose of this work are the last two chapters
of the book, “Where America Fell Short with Me,” and “What
I Owe to America,” which should be read by all those actively interested
in the Americanization of the foreign-born. In the first of
these he points out that America failed to teach him thrift or economy;
that the importance of doing a task thoroughly, the need of
quality rather than quantity, was not inculcated; that the public
school fell short in its responsibility of seeing that he, a foreign-born
boy, acquired the English language correctly; that he was not
impressed with a wholesome and proper respect for law and authority;
and that, at the most critical time, when he came to exercise
the right of suffrage, the State offered him no enlightenment or encouragement.
Yet, in spite of all this, he is able to say: “Whatever
shortcomings I may have found during my fifty-year period of
Americanization; however America may have failed to help my
transition from a foreigner into an American, I owe to her the most
priceless gift that any nation can offer, and that is opportunity.”</p></div>

<h3>AMERICA AND THE SPIRIT OF AMERICAN
JUDAISM</h3>

<p>The spirit of American Judaism first asserted itself when
Stuyvesant, the Governor of New Amsterdam, would not
permit the few Jews who had emigrated from Portugal to
unite with the other burghers in standing guard for the protection
of their homes. When the tax-collector came to
Asser Levy to demand a tax on this account, he asked
whether that tax was imposed on all the residents of New
Amsterdam. “No,” was the reply, “it is only imposed upon
the Jews, because they do not stand guard!” “I have not
asked to be exempted,” replied Asser Levy. “I am not only
willing, but I demand the right to stand guard.” That right
the Jews have asserted and exercised as officers in the ranks
of the Continental Army and in every crisis of our national
history from that time until the present day.</p>

<p>The American spirit and the spirit of American Judaism
were nurtured in the same cradle of Liberty, and were
united in origin, in ideals, and in historical development. The
closing chapter of the chronicles of the Jews on the Iberian
peninsula forms the opening chapter of their history on this
Continent. It was Luis Santangel, “the Beaconsfield of his
time,” assisted by his kinsman Gabriel Sanches, the Royal
Treasurer of Aragon, who advanced out of his own purse
seventeen thousand florins which made the voyages of Columbus
possible. Luis de Torres, the interpreter as well as the
surgeon and the physician of the little fleet, and several of the
sailors who were with Columbus on his first voyage, as shown
by the record, were Jews.</p>

<p>Looking back through this vista of more than four centuries,
we have reason to remember with justified gratitude
the foresight and signal services of those Spanish Jews who
had the wisdom to divine the far-reaching possibilities of the
plans of the great navigator, whom the King and the Queen,
the Dukes and the Grandees united in regarding as merely
“a visionary babbler” or, worse than this, as “a scheming<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
adventurer.” The royal patrons were finally won over by
the hope that Columbus might discover new treasures of
gold and precious stones to enrich the Spanish crown. But
not so with the Jewish patrons, who caused Columbus, or,
as he was then called, Christopher Colon, to be recalled, and
who, without security and without interest, advanced the
money to fit out his caravels, since they saw, as by divine inspiration,
the promise and possibility of the discovery of another
world, which, in the words of the late Emilio Castelar&mdash;the
historian, statesman, and one time President of Spain&mdash;“would
afford to the quickening principles of human liberty
a temple reared to the God of enfranchised and redeemed
conscience, a land that would offer an unstained
abode to the ideals of progress.” Fortunately, the records
of these transactions are still preserved in the archives of
Simancas in Seville.</p>

<p>It is idle to speculate upon hypothetical theories in the
face of the facts of history. Of course, America would have
been discovered and colonized had Columbus never lived;
but had the streams of the beginnings of American history
flown from other sources in other directions, it would be futile
even to make an imaginative forecast of the effect they would
have produced upon the history and development of this
Continent. The merciless intolerance of an ecclesiastical
system and the horror of its persecutions stimulated the
earliest immigration, and subsequently brought about the
Reformation in Saxon and Anglo-Saxon lands, and the same
spirit drove to our shores the Pilgrim and the Puritan fathers;
which chain of circumstances destined this country from
the very beginning to be the land of the immigrant and a
home for the fugitive and the persecuted.</p>

<p>The difference between government by kings and nobles
and government under a Democracy is, that the former
rests upon the power to compel obedience, while the latter
rests essentially upon the sacrifice by the individual for the
community, based upon the ideals of right and justice. If
the Pilgrims, the Puritans, and the Huguenots brought with
them, as they certainly did, the remembrance of sufferings for<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
ideals and the spirit of sacrifice, how much longer was that
remembrance, and with how much greater intensity did that
spirit glow in the souls of the Jews, whose whole history is
a record of martyrdom, of suffering, and of sacrifice for the
ideals of civil and religious liberty; concerning whom it has
been said: “Of all the races and nations of mankind which
quarter the arms of Liberty on the shields of their honor,
none has a better title to that decoration than the Jews.”</p>

<p>The spirit of Judaism became the mother spirit of Puritanism
in Old England; and the history of Israel and its democratic
model under the Judges inspired and guided the Pilgrims
and the Puritans in their wandering hither and in laying
the foundation of their commonwealths in New England.
The piety and learning of the Jews bridged the chasm
of the Middle Ages; and the torch they bore amidst trials
and sufferings lighted the pathway from the ancient to the
modern world.</p>

<p>“The historical power of the prophets of Israel,” says
James Darmesteter, “is exhausted neither by Judaism nor by
Christianity, and they hold a reserve force for the benefit of
the coming century. The twentieth century is better prepared
than the nineteen preceding it to understand them.”
While Zionism is a pious hope and a vision out of despair in
countries where the victims of oppression are still counted by
millions, the republicanism of the United States is the nearest
approach to the ideals of the prophets of Israel that ever has
been incorporated in the form of a state. The founders of
our government converted the dreams of philosophers into a
political system,&mdash;a government by the people, for the people,
whereunder the rights of man became the rights of men, secured
and guaranteed by a written constitution. Ours is peculiarly
a promised land wherein the spirit of the teachings
of the ancient prophets inspired the work of the fathers of
our country.</p>

<p>American liberty demands of no man the abandonment of
his conscientious convictions; on the contrary, it had its birth,
not in the narrowness of uniformity, but in the breadth of
diversity, which patriotism fuses together into a conscious<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
harmony for the highest welfare of all. The Protestant, the
Catholic, and the Jew, each and all need the support and the
sustaining power of their religion to develop their moral natures
and to keep alive the spirit of self-sacrifice which American
patriotism demands of every man, whatever may be his
creed or race, who is worthy to enjoy the blessings of American
citizenship.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be misunderstood as claiming any special
merit for the Jews as American citizens which is not equally
possessed by the Americans of other creeds. They have the
good as well as the bad among them, the noble and the
ignoble, the worthy and the unworthy. They have the qualities
as well as the defects of their fellow-citizens. In a
word, they are not any less patriotic Americans because they
are Jews, nor any less loyal Jews because they are primarily
patriotic Americans.</p>

<p>The Jew is neither a newcomer nor an alien in this country
or on this continent; his Americanism is as original and
ancient as that of any race or people with the exception of the
American Indian and other aborigines. He came in the
caravels of Columbus, and he knocked at the gates of New
Amsterdam only thirty-five years after the Pilgrim Fathers
stepped ashore on Plymouth Rock.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FELIX ADLER</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Felix Adler, lecturer and writer on moral and ethical subjects,
was born in Alzey, Germany, in 1851. He received the degree A.B.
from Columbia University, and continued his studies at Berlin and
at the University of Heidelberg. From 1874 to 1876 he was professor
of Hebrew at Cornell University. Since 1902 he has been
professor of political and social ethics at Columbia. He has produced
numerous works on moral and ethical topics. In 1915 there was
published his book, “The World Crisis and its Meaning,” the third
chapter of which is here quoted in part.</p>

<p>Adler’s keen interest in international ethics has been expressed in
several addresses delivered before the New York Society of Ethical
Culture, which was founded by him in 1876. Among other things
he pleads for altruism among the nations, and truthfulness, and believes
in a purified nationalism instead of anti- or inter-nationalism.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_78" class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>


<h3>THE AMERICAN IDEAL</h3>

<p>The American ideal is that of the uncommon quality latent
in the common man. Necessarily it is an ethical ideal, a
spiritual ideal; otherwise it would be nonsense. For, taking
men as they are, they are assuredly not equal. The differences
between them, on the contrary, are glaring. The common
man is not uncommonly fine spiritually, but rather, seen
from the outside, “uncommonly” common. It is therefore
an ethical instinct that has turned the people toward this
ethical conception.</p>

<p>It is true that in Germany and in England, side by side
with the efficiency and the mastery ideals, there has always
existed this same spiritual or religious ideal; side by side with
the stratification and entitulation of men, the labelling of
them as lower and higher, as empirically better or worse,
there has always been the recognition that men are equal,&mdash;equal,
that is to say, in church, but not outside, equal in the
hereafter, but not in this life. If we would fathom the real
depth and inner significance of the democratic ideal as it
slumbers or dreams in the heart of America, rather than as
yet explicit, we must say that it is an ideal which seeks to
overcome this very dualism, seeks to take the spiritual conception
of human equality out of the church and put it into
the market place, to take it from far off celestial realms for
realization upon this earth. For men are not equal in the
empirical sense; they are equal only in the spiritual sense,
equal only in the sense that the margin of achievement of
which any person is capable, be it wide or narrow, is infinitesimal
compared with his infinite spiritual possibilities.</p>

<p>It is because of this subconscious ethical motive that there
is this generous air of expectation in America, that we are
always wondering what will happen next, or who will happen
next. Will another Emerson come along? Will another
Lincoln come along? We do not know. But this we
know, that the greatest lusters of our past already tend to
fade in our memory, not because we are irreverent, but because<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
nothing that the past has accomplished can content us;
because we are looking for greatness beyond greatness, truth
beyond truth ever yet spoken. The Germans have a legend
that in their hour of need an ancient emperor will arise out
of the tomb where he slumbers to stretch his protecting hand
over the Fatherland. We Americans, too, have the belief
that, if ever such an hour comes for us, there will arise spirits
clothed in human flesh amongst us sufficient for our need, but
spirits that will come, as it were, out of the future to meet
our advancing host and lead it, not ghosts out of the storied
past. For America differs from all other nations in that it
derives its inspiration from the future. Every other people
has some culture, some civilization, handed down from the
past, of which it is the custodian, and which it seeks to develop.
The American people have no such single tradition.
They are dedicated, not to the preservation of what has been,
but to the creation of what never has been. They are the
prophets of the future, not the priests of the past.</p>

<p>I have spoken above of ideals, of what is fine in a nation,
of fine tendencies. The idea which a people has of itself,
like the idea which an individual has of himself, often does
not tally with the reality. If we look at the realities of
American life,&mdash;and, on the principle of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corruptio optimi
pessima</i>, we should be prepared for what we see,&mdash;we are
dismayed to observe in actual practice what seems like a monstrous
caricature,&mdash;not democracy, but plutocracy; kings expelled
and the petty political bosses in their stead; merciless
exploitation of the economically weak,&mdash;a precipitate reduction
of wages, for instance, at the first signs of approaching
depression, in advance of what is required,&mdash;instead of respect
for the sacred personality of human beings, the utmost
disrespect. Certainly the nation needs strong and persistent
ethical teaching in order to make it aware of its better self
and of what is implied in the political institutions which it
has founded.</p>

<p>But ethical teaching alone will not suffice. It must be admitted
that a danger lurks in the idea of equality itself. The
danger is that differences in refinement, in culture, in intellectual<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
ability and attainments are apt to be insufficiently
emphasized; that the untutored, the uncultivated, the intellectually
undeveloped, are apt presumptuously to put themselves
on a par with those of superior development; and hence
that superiority, failing to meet with recognition, will be
discouraged and democracy tend to level men downward instead
of upward. This will not be true so much of such moral
excellence as appears in an Emerson or a Lincoln,&mdash;for there
is that in the lowliest which responds to the manifestations
of transcendent moral beauty,&mdash;but it will hold good of those
minor superiorities that fall short of the highest in art and
science and conduct, yet upon the fostering of which depends
the eventual appearance of culture’s richest fruits.</p>

<p>In order to ward off this danger we must have a new and
larger educational policy in our schools than has yet been put
in practice. Vocational training in its broadest and deepest
sense will be our greatest aid.</p>

<p>Democracy, the American democracy, is the St. Christopher.
St. Christopher bore the Christ child on his shoulders
as he stepped into the river, and the child was as light as a
feather. But it became heavier and heavier as he entered
the stream, until he was well nigh borne down by it. So we,
in the heyday of 1776, stepped into the stream with the infant
Democracy on our shoulders, and it was light as a
feather’s weight; but it is becoming heavier and heavier the
deeper we are getting into the stream&mdash;heavier and heavier.
When we began, there were four or five millions. Now
there are ninety millions. Heavier and heavier! And there
are other millions coming. When we began we were a
homogeneous people; now there are those twenty-three languages
spoken in a single school. And with this vast multitude,
and this heterogeneous population, we are trying the
most difficult experiment that has ever been attempted in the
world,&mdash;trying to invest with sovereignty the common man.
There has been the sovereignty of kings, and now and then
a king has done well. There has been the sovereignty of
aristocracies, and now and then an English aristocracy or a
Venetian aristocracy has done well&mdash;though never wholly<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
well. And now we are imposing this most difficult task of
government, which depends on the recognition of excellence
in others, so that the best may rule in our behalf, on the
shoulders of the multitude. These are our difficulties. But
our difficulties are also our opportunities. This land is the
Promised Land. It is that not only in the sense in which the
word is commonly taken&mdash;that is to say, a haven for the disadvantaged
of other countries, a land whither the oppressed
may come to repair their fortunes and breathe freely and
achieve material independence. That is but one side of the
promise. In that sense the Anglo-American native population
is the host, extending hospitality, the benefactor of the
immigrants. But this is also the land of promise for the native
population themselves, in order that they may be penetrated
by the influence of what is best in the newcomers, in
order that their too narrow horizon may be widened, in order
that their stiffened mental bent may become more flexible;
that festivity, pageant and song may be added to their life by
the newcomers; that echoes of ancient prophecy may inspire
the matter-of-fact, progressive movements, so-called, of our
day.</p>

<p>America is the Wonderland, hid for ages in the secret of
the sea, then revealed. At first, how abused! Spanish conquerors
trampled it; it was the nesting place of buccaneers,
adventurers, if also the home of the Puritans&mdash;bad men and
good men side by side. Then for dreary centuries the home
of slavery. Then the scene of prolonged strife. And now,
on the surface, the stamping ground of vulgar plutocrats!
And yet, in the hearts of the elect,&mdash;yes, and in the hearts of
the masses, too,&mdash;inarticulate and dim, there has ever been
present a fairer and nobler ideal, the ideal of a Republic
built on the uncommon fineness in the common man! To
live for that ideal is the true Americanism, the larger patriotism.
To that ideal, not on the field of battle, as in
Europe, but in the arduous toil of peace, let us be willing to
give the “last full measure of devotion.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With the publication in 1912 of Mary Antin’s “The Promised

and since then several important autobiographies of immigrants
have appeared.</p>

<p>Miss Antin, who was born in Polotzk, Russia, in 1881, and came
to America in 1894, was educated in the public schools of Boston,

fine tribute to the part of the public school in her Americanization.</p>

<h3>AN IMMIGRANT’S TRIBUTE TO THE PUBLIC
SCHOOL AND TO GEORGE WASHINGTON</h3>

<p>The public school has done its best for us foreigners, and
for the country, when it has made us into good Americans.
I am glad it is mine to tell how the miracle was wrought in
one case. You should be glad to hear of it, you born Americans;
for it is the story of the growth of your country; of
the flocking of your brothers and sisters from the far ends of
the earth to the flag you love; of the recruiting of your armies
of workers, thinkers, and leaders. And you will be glad to
hear of it, my comrades in adoption; for it is a rehearsal of
your own experience, the thrill and wonder of which your
own hearts have felt.</p>

<p>How long would you say, wise reader, it takes to make an
American? By the middle of my second year in school I had
reached the sixth grade. When, after the Christmas holidays,
we began to study the life of Washington, running
through a summary of the Revolution, and the early days of
the Republic, it seemed to me that all my reading and study
had been idle until then. The reader, the arithmetic, the
song book, that had so fascinated me until now, became suddenly
sober exercise books, tools wherewith to hew a way to
the source of inspiration. When the teacher read to us out
of a big book with many bookmarks in it, I sat rigid with attention
in my little chair, my hands tightly clasped on the
edge of my desk; and I painfully held my breath, to prevent
sighs of disappointment escaping, as I saw the teacher skip the
parts between bookmarks. When the class read, and it came
my turn, my voice shook and the book trembled in my hands.
I could not pronounce the name of George Washington
without a pause. Never had I prayed, never had I chanted
the songs of David, never had I called upon the Most Holy,
in such utter reverence and worship as I repeated the simple
sentences of my child’s story of the patriot. I gazed with
adoration at the portraits of George and Martha Washington,<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
till I could see them with my eyes shut. And whereas
formerly my self-consciousness had bordered on conceit, and
I thought myself an uncommon person, parading my schoolbooks
through the streets, and swelling with pride when a
teacher detained me in conversation, now I grew humble all
at once, seeing how insignificant I was beside the Great.</p>

<p>As I read about the noble boy who would not tell a lie to
save himself from punishment, I was for the first time truly
repentant of my sins. Formerly I had fasted and prayed and
made sacrifice on the Day of Atonement, but it was more than
half play, in mimicry of my elders. I had no real horror of
sin, and I knew so many ways of escaping punishment. I am
sure my family, my neighbors, my teachers in Polotzk&mdash;all
my world, in fact&mdash;strove together, by example and precept,
to teach me goodness. Saintliness had a new incarnation in
about every third person I knew. I did respect the saints,
but I could not help seeing that most of them were a little
bit stupid, and that mischief was much more fun than piety.
Goodness, as I had known it, was respectable, but not necessarily
admirable. The people I really admired, like my Uncle
Solomon and Cousin Rachel, were those who preached the
least and laughed the most. My sister Frieda was perfectly
good, but she did not think the less of me because I played
tricks. What I loved in my friends was not inimitable. One
could be downright good if one really wanted to. One
could be learned if one had books and teachers. One could
sing funny songs and tell anecdotes if one traveled about and
picked up such things, like one’s uncles and cousins. But a
human being strictly good, perfectly wise, and unfailingly
valiant, all at the same time, I had never heard or dreamed
of. This wonderful George Washington was as inimitable
as he was irreproachable. Even if I had never, never told a
lie, I could not compare myself to George Washington; for I
was not brave,&mdash;I was afraid to go out when snowballs
whizzed,&mdash;and I could never be the First President of the
United States.</p>

<p>So I was forced to revise my own estimate of myself. But
the twin of my new-born humility, paradoxical as it may<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
seem, was a sense of dignity I had never known before. For
if I found that I was a person of small consequence, I discovered
at the same time that I was more nobly related than
I had ever supposed. I had relatives and friends who were
notable people by the old standards,&mdash;and I had never been
ashamed of my family,&mdash;-but this George Washington, who
died long before I was born, was like a king in greatness,
and he and I were Fellow-Citizens. There was a great deal
about Fellow-Citizens in the patriotic literature we read at
this time; and I knew from my father how he was a Citizen
through the process of naturalization, and how I also was a
Citizen by virtue of my relation to him. Undoubtedly I was
a Fellow-Citizen, and George Washington was another. It
thrilled me to realize what sudden greatness had fallen on
me, and at the same time sobered me, as with a sense of responsibility.
I strove to conduct myself as befitted a Fellow-Citizen.</p>

<p>Before books came into my life, I was given to stargazing
and daydreaming. When books were given me, I fell upon
them as a glutton pounces on his meat after a period of enforced
starvation. I lived with my nose in a book, and took
no notice of the alterations of the sun and stars. But now,
after the advent of George Washington and the American
Revolution, I began to dream again. I strayed on the Common
after school instead of hurrying home to read. I hung
on fence rails, my pet book forgotten under my arm, and
gazed off to the yellow-streaked February sunset, and beyond,
and beyond. I was no longer the central figure of my
dreams; the dry weeds in the lane crackled beneath the tread
of Heroes.</p>

<p>What more could America give a child? Ah, much more!
As I read how the patriots planned the Revolution, and the
women gave their sons to die in battle, and the heroes led to
victory, and the rejoicing people set up the Republic, it
dawned on me gradually what was meant by <em>my country</em>.
The people all desiring noble things, and striving for them
together, defying their oppressors, giving their lives for each
other,&mdash;all this it was that made <em>my country</em>. It was not a<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
thing that I <em>understood</em>; I could not go home and tell Frieda
about it, as I told her other things I learned at school. But I
knew one could say “my country” and <em>feel</em> it, as one felt
“God” or “myself.” My teacher, my schoolmates, Miss
Dillingham, George Washington himself, could not mean
more than I when they said “my country,” after I had once
felt it. For the Country was for all the Citizens, and <em>I was
a citizen</em>. And when we stood up to sing “America,” I
shouted the words with all my might. I was in very earnest
proclaiming to the world my love for my new-found country.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“I love thy rocks and rills,
</div><div class="indent0">Thy woods and templed hills.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Boston Harbor, Crescent Beach, Chelsea Square,&mdash;all was
hallowed ground to me. As the day approached when the
school was to hold exercises in honor of Washington’s Birthday,
the halls resounded at all hours with the strains of patriotic
songs; and I, who was a model of the attentive pupil,
more than once lost my place in the lesson as I strained to
hear, through closed doors, some neighboring class rehearsing
“The Star-Spangled Banner.” If the doors happened to
open, and the chorus broke out unveiled,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“O! say, does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave
</div><div class="indent0">O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>delicious tremors ran up and down my spine, and I was faint
with suppressed enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Where had been my country until now? What flag had
I loved? What heroes had I worshipped? The very names
of these things had been unknown to me. Well I knew that
Polotzk was not my country. It was <i lang="yi" xml:lang="yi">goluth</i>&mdash;exile. On
many occasions in the year we prayed to God to lead us out
of exile. The beautiful Passover service closed with the
words, “Next year, may we be in Jerusalem.” On childish
lips, indeed, those words were no conscious aspiration; we
repeated the Hebrew syllables after our elders, but without
their hope and longing. Still not a child among us was too<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
young to feel in his own flesh the lash of the oppressor. We
knew what it was to be Jews in exile, from the spiteful
treatment we suffered at the hands of the smallest urchin
who crossed himself; and thence we knew that Israel had
good reason to pray for deliverance. But the story of the
Exodus was not history to me in the sense that the story of
the American Revolution was. It was more like a glorious
myth, a belief in which had the effect of cutting me off from
the actual world, by linking me with a world of phantoms.
Those moments of exaltation which the contemplation of
the Biblical past afforded us, allowing us to call ourselves the
children of princes, served but to tinge with a more poignant
sense of disinheritance the long humdrum stretches of our
life. In very truth we were a people without a country.
Surrounded by mocking foes and detractors, it was difficult
for me to realize the persons of my people’s heroes or the
events in which they moved. Except in moments of abstraction
from the world around me, I scarcely understood
that Jerusalem was an actual spot on the earth, where once
the Kings of the Bible, real people, like my neighbors in
Polotzk, ruled in puissant majesty. For the conditions of
our civil life did not permit us to cultivate a spirit of nationalism.
The freedom of worship that was grudgingly
granted within the narrow limits of the Pale by no means
included the right to set up openly any ideal of a Hebrew
State, any hero other than the Czar. What we children
picked up of our ancient political history was confused with
the miraculous story of the Creation, with the supernatural
legends and hazy associations of Bible lore. As to our future,
we Jews in Polotzk had no national expectations; only a
life-worn dreamer here and there hoped to die in Palestine.
If Fetchke and I sang, with my father, first making sure of
our audience, “Zion, Zion, Holy Zion, not forever is it lost,”
we did not really picture to ourselves Judæa restored.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that we did not know what <em>my country</em>
could mean to a man. And as we had no country, so we
had no flag to love. It was by no far-fetched symbolism
that the banner of the House of Romanoff became the emblem<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
of our latter-day bondage in our eyes. Even a child would
know how to hate the flag that we were forced, on pain of
severe penalties, to hoist above our housetops, in celebration of
the advent of one of our oppressors. And as it was with
country and flag, so it was with heroes of war. We hated the
uniform of the soldier, to the last brass button. On the person
of a Gentile, it was the symbol of tyranny; on the person of a
Jew, it was the emblem of shame.</p>

<p>So a little Jewish girl in Polotzk was apt to grow up hungry-minded
and empty-hearted; and if, still in her outreaching
youth, she was set down in a land of outspoken patriotism,
she was likely to love her new country with a great
love, and to embrace its heroes in a great worship. Naturalization,
with us Russian Jews, may mean more than the adoption
of the immigrant by America. It may mean the adoption
of America by the immigrant.</p>

<h3>THE LAW OF THE FATHERS: A VIEW OF
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</h3>

<p>If I ask an American what is the fundamental American
law, and he does not answer me promptly, “That which is
contained in the Declaration of Independence,” I put him
down for a poor citizen. He who is ignorant of the law is
likely to disobey it. And there cannot be two minds about
the position of the Declaration among our documents of
State. What the Mosaic Law is to the Jews, the Declaration
is to the American people. It affords us a starting-point
in history and defines our mission among the nations.
Without it, we should not differ greatly from other nations
who achieved a constitutional form of government and various
democratic institutions. What marks us out from other
advanced nations is the origin of our liberties in one supreme
act of political innovation, prompted by a conscious sense of
the dignity of manhood. In other countries advances have
been made by favor of hereditary rulers and aristocratic parliaments,
each successive reform being grudgingly handed
down to the people from above. Not so in America. At
one bold stroke we shattered the monarchical tradition, and
installed the people in the seats of government, substituting
the gospel of the sovereignty of the masses for the superstition
of the divine right of kings.</p>

<p>And even more notable than the boldness of the act was
the dignity with which it was entered upon. In terms befitting
a philosophical discourse, we gave notice to the world
that what we were about to do, we would do in the name of
humanity, in the conviction that as justice is the end of government,
so should manhood be its source.</p>

<p>It is this insistence on the philosophic sanction of our revolt
that gives the sublime touch to our political performance.
Up to the moment of our declaration of independence,
our struggle with our English rulers did not differ from
other popular struggles against despotic governments. Again<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
and again we respectfully petitioned for redress of specific
grievances, as the governed, from time immemorial, have
petitioned their governors. But one day we abandoned our
suit for petty damages, and instituted a suit for the recovery
of our entire human heritage of freedom; and by basing our
claim on the fundamental principles of the brotherhood of
man and the sovereignty of the masses, we assumed the
championship of the oppressed against their oppressors, wherever
found.</p>

<p>It was thus, by sinking our particular quarrel with George
of England in the universal quarrel of humanity with injustice,
that we emerged a distinct nation, with a unique mission
in the world. And we revealed ourselves to the world in
the Declaration of Independence, even as the Israelites revealed
themselves in the Law of Moses. From the
Declaration flows our race consciousness, our sense of what
is and what is not American. Our laws, our policies, the
successive steps of our progress,&mdash;all must conform to the
spirit of the Declaration of Independence, the source of our
national being.</p>

<p>The American confession of faith, therefore, is a recital of
the doctrines of liberty and equality. A faithful American
is one who understands these doctrines and applies them in
his life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ABRAHAM MITRIE RIHBANY</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>An intense seriousness is one of the prominent characteristics of
the writings of the immigrant; for immigration is a serious and
often a hazardous undertaking, as the immigrant best knows. But
that he has not failed to appreciate the amusing side of the readjustment
period is evidenced by the many touches of humor in his
accounts of his relation to his new environment. One of the most
pleasing and inspiriting of these accounts is “A Far Journey,” by
Abraham M. Rihbany, who was born in Syria in the year 1869, and
who came to the United States with little money, but with much
native intelligence and an open and receptive mind and soul, eager
for the very best that America has to give.</p>

<p>The bad effects of the gregariousness of the foreigner in America
have frequently been pointed out and deplored; most writers on
immigration have failed to see or mention any of its benefits. It is
interesting to know the opinion on this vexing question of one who
has himself passed safely through a critical transition period. Speaking
of his own experience he says that the Syrian colony in New
York “was a habitat so much like the one I had left behind me in
Syria that its home atmosphere enabled me to maintain a firm hold
on life in the face of the many difficulties which confronted me in
those days, and just different enough to awaken my curiosity to
know more about the surrounding American influences.” Impelled
by the question, “Where is America?” and longing for “something
more in the life of America than the mere loaves and fishes,” he
determined to leave New York and “seek the smaller centers of population,
where men came in friendly touch with one another, daily.”</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_92" class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">AMERICA OFFERS SOMETHING BETTER
THAN MONEY</h3>

<p>I was told while in Syria that in America money could be
picked up everywhere. That was not true. But I found
that infinitely better things than money&mdash;knowledge, freedom,
self-reliance, order, cleanliness, sovereign human
rights, self-government, and all that these great accomplishments
imply&mdash;can be picked up everywhere in America by
whosoever earnestly seeks them. And those among Americans
who are exerting the largest influence toward the solution
of the “immigration problem” are, in my opinion, not
those who are writing books on “good citizenship,” but those
who stand before the foreigner as the embodiment of these
great ideals.</p>

<p>The occasions on which I was made to feel that I was a
foreigner&mdash;an alien&mdash;were so rare that they are not worth
mentioning. My purpose in life, and the large, warm heart
of America which opens to every person who aspires to be a
good and useful citizen, made me forget that there was an
“immigration problem” within the borders of this great
Commonwealth. When I think of the thousand noble impulses
which were poured into my soul in my early years in
this country by good men and women in all walks of life;
when I think of the many homes in which I was received
with my uncomely appearance and with my crude manners,
where women who were visions of elegance served me as an
honored guest, of the many counsels of men of affairs which
fed my strength and taught me the lasting value of personal
achievements, and that America is the land of not only great
privileges, but great responsibilities, I feel like saying (and
I do say whenever I have the opportunity) to every foreigner,
“When you really know what America is, when you
are willing to share in its sorrows, as well as its joys, then
you will cease to be a whining malcontent, will take your
harp down from the willows, and will not call such a country
‘a strange land.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>Of all the means of improvement other than personal associations
with good men and women, the churches and the
public schools gripped most strongly at the strings of my
heart. Upon coming into town, the sight of the church
spires rising above the houses and the trees as witnesses to man’s
desire for God, always gave me inward delight. True, religion
in America lacks to a certain extent the depth of Oriental
mysticism; yet it is much more closely related than in the
Orient to the vital issues of “the life which now is.” Often
would I go and stand on the opposite side of the street from a
public-school building at the hour of dismissal (and this passion
still remains with me) just for the purpose of feasting
my eyes on seeing the pupils pour out in squads, so clean and
so orderly, and seemingly animated by all that is noblest in
the life of this great nation. My soul would revel in the
thought that no distinctions were made in those temples of
learning between Jew and Gentile, Protestant and Catholic,
the churched and the unchurched; all enjoyed the equality
of privileges, shared equally in the intellectual and moral
feast, and drank freely the spirit of the noblest patriotism.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">AN IMMIGRANT TELLS HIS STRUGGLES
WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</h3>

<p>My struggles with the English language (which have not
yet ceased) were at times very hard. It is not at all difficult
for me to realize the agonizing inward struggles of a person
who has lost the power of speech. When I was first compelled
to set aside my mother-tongue and use English exclusively
as my medium of expression, the sphere of my life
seemed to shrink to a very small disk. My pretentious purpose
of suddenly becoming a lecturer on Oriental customs,
in a language in which practically I had never conversed,
might have seemed to any one who knew me like an act of
faith in the miraculous gift of tongues. My youthful desire
was not only to inform but to <em>move</em> my hearers. Consequently,
my groping before an audience for suitable diction
within the narrow limits of my uncertain vocabulary was
often pitiable.</p>

<p>The exceptions in English grammar seemed to be more
than the rules. The difference between the conventional
and the actual sounds of such words as “victuals” and
“colonel” seemed to me to be perfectly scandalous. The letter
<em>c</em> is certainly a superfluity in the English language; it is
never anything else but either <em>k</em> or <em>s</em>. In my native language,
the Arabic, the accent is always put as near the end of the
word as possible; in the English, as near the beginning as
possible. Therefore, in using my adopted tongue, I was
tossed between the two extremes and very often “split the
difference” by taking a middle course. The sounds of the
letters, <em>v</em>, <em>p</em>, and the hard <em>g</em>, are not represented in the
Arabic. They are symbolized in transliteration by the equivalents
of <em>f</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>k</em>. On numerous occasions, therefore, and
especially when I waxed eloquent, my tongue would mix
these sounds hopelessly, to the amused surprise of my hearers.
I would say “coal” when I meant “goal,” “pig man”
for “big man,” “buy” for “pie,” “ferry” for “very,” and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice<span class="pagenum normalfont">[95]</span>
versa</i>. For some time I had, of course, to think in Arabic
and try to translate my thoughts <em>literally</em> into English, which
practice caused me many troubles, especially in the use of the
connectives. On one occasion, when an American gentleman
told me that he was a Presbyterian, and I, rejoicing to
claim fellowship with him, sought to say what should have
been, “We are brethren in Christ,” I said, “We are brothers,
by Jesus.” My Presbyterian friend put his finger on his lip
in pious fashion, and, with elevated brows and a most sympathetic
smile, said, “That is swearing!”</p>

<p>But in my early struggles with English, I derived much
negative consolation from the mistakes Americans made in
pronouncing my name. None of them could pronounce it
correctly&mdash;Rih-bá-ny&mdash;without my assistance. I have been
called Rib-beny, Richbany, Ribary, Laborny, Rabonie, and
many other names. An enterprising Sunday School superintendent
in the Presbyterian Church at Mansfield, Ohio, introduced
me to his school by saying, “Now we have the
pleasure of listening to Mr. Rehoboam!” The prefixing of
“Mr.” to the name of the scion of King Solomon seemed to
me to annihilate time and space, and showed me plainly how
the past might be brought forward and made to serve the
present.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDWARD ALFRED STEINER</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>None of our immigrant authors has written with more earnestness
of America and things American than Edward A. Steiner, who
was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1866. Unlike the average immigrant,
before coming to the United States he had received considerable
education in the public schools of his native city, in the gymnasium
at Pilsen, Bohemia, and at the University of Heidelberg.
After passing through most of the hardships incident to the life of
an alien, he was graduated from the Oberlin Theological Seminary
and was ordained a minister of the Congregational Church. Several
years were then spent in pastoral work, and in 1903 he was elected
to the Chair of Applied Christianity at Grinnell College, Iowa. He
is widely known both as a lecturer and an author, and among his
numerous books may be mentioned “On the Trail of the Immigrant,”
1906; “Against the Current,” 1910; “From Alien to Citizen,” 1914;
“Introducing the American Spirit,” 1915; “Nationalizing America,”
1916; “Confession of a Hyphenated American,” 1916. This
last voices the sensitiveness so commonly felt by Americans of
foreign and particularly German birth in the face of much unreasonable
suspicion and prejudice prior to and at the entrance of the
United States into the European War. “Nationalizing America” is
perhaps his most searching book; for in this almost every American
institution is scrutinized, the State, the Church, the school, and
the industrial life being examined in their relation to the immigrant.</p>

<p>Selections from two chapters of this book (“The Stomach Line”
and “History and the Nation”) have been combined under one title,
“Industrialism and the Immigrant.” “The Criminal Immigrant” is
taken from chapter fourteen of the autobiographical volume, “From
Alien to Citizen.”<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

<p><span id="Page_97" class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE CRIMINAL IMMIGRANT</h3>

<p>To recall prison experiences is not pleasant, and would not
be profitable, if this were merely a narration of what happened
to one individual, a quarter of a century ago. Conditions
are not sufficiently changed, either in judicial procedure
or in methods of punishment, to make this account of <em>historic</em>
importance. Its value lies only in the fact that <em>no changes</em>
have occurred, and that my experience then is still the common
fate of multitudes of immigrants, who swell the criminal
records of their race or group, and are therefore looked
upon with dislike and apprehension.</p>

<p>The jail in which I found myself was an unredeemed,
vermin-infested building, crowded by a motley multitude of
strikers and strike breakers,&mdash;bitter enemies all, their animosity
begotten in the elemental struggle for bread, and hating
one another with an unmodified, primitive passion.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The strikers had the advantage over us, for they were
more numerous and were acquainted with the ways of
American officials. This gave them the opportunity (which
they improved) to make it unpleasant for the “Hunkies.”</p>

<p>The straw mattress upon which I slept the first night was
missing the second; salt more completely spoiled the mixture
called by courtesy coffee, and the only thing which saved me
from bodily hurt was the fact that there was no spot on me
which was not already suffering.</p>

<p>I mention without malice and merely as a fact in race
psychology, that the Irish were the most cruel to us, with the
Germans a close second, while the Welsh were not only inoffensive,
but sometimes kind.</p>

<p>One of them, David Hill&mdash;smaller than the ordinary
Welshman, but with the courage of his Biblical namesake&mdash;stood
between me and a burly Irish Goliath who wanted to
thrash this particular “furriner, who came over here to take<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
away the bread from the lips of <em>dacent, law-abiding</em> Americans.”</p>

<p>The jailer maintained no discipline and heeded no complaints.
His task was to keep us locked up; the bars were
strong and the key invariably turned.</p>

<p>The strikers gradually drifted from the jail, being bailed
out or released, and I was not sorry to see them go.</p>

<p>Poor food, vermin of many varieties and the various small
tortures endured, were all as nothing to me compared with
the fact that for more than six weeks I was permitted to be
in that jail without a hearing; without even the slightest
knowledge on my part as to why I had forfeited my liberty.</p>

<p>From the barred jail window I could see the workmen
going unhindered to their tasks; on Sunday pastor and people
passed, as they went to worship their Lord who, too, was
once a prisoner. None, seemingly, gave us a thought or even
responded by a smile to the hunger for sympathy which I
know my face must have expressed.</p>

<p>My letters to the Austro-Hungarian Consul remained unanswered,
and the jailer gave my repeated questionings only
oaths for reply.</p>

<p>The day of my hearing finally came, and I was dragged
before the judge. The proceedings were shockingly disorderly,
irreverent and unjust. I was charged with shooting
to kill. The weapon which had been found in my pocket
was the revolver bequeathed me by the dying man in the
Pittsburgh boarding house. As all its six cartridges were
safely embedded in rust, the charge was changed to “carrying
concealed weapons.” I think my readers will agree
with me that the sentence of one hundred dollars fine and
three months in the county jail was out of all proportion to
the offence.</p>

<p>The court wasted exactly ten minutes on my case, and
then I was returned to my quarters in the jail, an accredited
prisoner. Let me here record the fact that I carried back
to my cell a fierce sense of injustice and a contempt for the
laws of this land and its officials, feelings that later ripened
into active sympathy with anarchy, which at that time occupied<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
the attention of the American people. My knowledge of
that subject came to me through old newspapers which
drifted as waste around the jail.</p>

<p>In all those months, more than six, for my fine had to be
worked out, or rather idled out, no one came to me to comfort
or explain. For more than six months I was with
thugs, tramps, thieves and vermin. I was a criminal immigrant,
a component element of the new immigration problem.</p>

<p>I recall all this now in no spirit of vengeance; as far as
my memory is concerned, I have purged it of all hate. I
recall my experience because those same conditions exist to-day
in more aggravated form, while multitudes of ignorant,
innocent men suffer and die in our jails and penitentiaries.</p>

<p>Since then I have visited most of the county jails, prisons
and penitentiaries in which immigrants are likely to be found.
Intelligent and humane wardens, of whom there are a few,
have told me that more than half the alien prisoners are
suffering innocently, from transgressing laws of which they
were ignorant, and that their punishment is too often much
more severe than necessary.</p>

<p>The following narration of several incidents which recently
came under my observation will be pardoned, I hope,
when their full import is seen.</p>

<p>Not long ago I went to lecture in a Kansas town,&mdash;one
of those irreproachable communities in which it is good to
bring up children because of the moral atmosphere. The
town has a New England conscience with a Kansas attachment.
It boasts of having been a station in the underground
railway, and it maintains a most uncompromising attitude
toward certain social delinquencies, especially the sale
of liquor.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival I was cordially received by a committee,
and one of its members told me that the jail was full of
criminal foreigners&mdash;Greeks. What crimes they had committed
he did not know.</p>

<p>Recalling my own experience, I made inquiries and found
that six Greeks were in the county jail. They had been<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
arrested in September (it was now March) charged with
the heinous crime of having gone to the unregenerate State
of Nebraska, where they purchased a barrel of beer which
they drank on the Sabbath day in their camp by the railroad.</p>

<p>Possibly these Greeks were just ignorant foreigners and
now harbor no sense of injustice suffered; possibly they still
think this country “the land of the free and the home of the
brave.” They may even be ready to obey its laws and reverence
its institutions. I do not know how they feel, but I
do know this: those Greeks were kept in prison for breaking
a law of which they were ignorant, and even if they
were aware of its existence and broke it knowingly, the
punishment did not fit the crime.</p>

<p>They were kept as criminals and regarded as criminals;
they were unvisited and uncomforted; and they were incarcerated
at a time when their country called for her native
sons to do battle against the Turk.</p>

<p>Some day the sense of injustice suffered may come to
them, and they will ask themselves whether every man in
Kansas who drinks beer is punished as they were. They will
wonder why real criminals go free, or escape with
nominal punishment. I venture to predict that in some
great crisis, when this country needs men who respect her
laws and love her institutions, these men, and multitudes of
others who have suffered such injustices as they have, will
fail her.</p>

<p>I pleaded for those imprisoned Greeks that night, and my
plea was effective. The just judge who condemned them
pardoned them; but so just was he that the fine of one hundred
dollars each, not yet paid, was left hanging over them,
and to their credit be it said, they remained in that town
and paid every cent of it. This judge no doubt knows his
New Testament; he certainly made the Greeks pay the
“uttermost farthing” before his outraged sense of justice was
appeased.</p>

<p>Those Greeks spent, together, over three years in jail,<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
forfeited more than fifteen hundred dollars in wages, and
lost in bodily health and self-respect beyond calculation.</p>

<p>Another incident occurred last spring as I was passing
through a border on one of those nerve-racking coal roads.</p>

<p>At a small, desolate mining village a group of men entered
the car, unwillingly enough. They were chained to
one another and were driven to their seats with curses and
the butt of a gun. They were Italian miners, part of that
human material now scattered all over the United States,
carried by something swifter, though not less insistent than
the glacial movements which graved the beds of the rivers
and shifted so much of earth’s original scenery. There was
some danger of violence, and the accompanying minions of the
law held back the angry passengers. There was scarcely a
moment, however, when they themselves did not apply some
vigorous measure to assure themselves that three undersized
Southern Italians, chained to one another, should not escape
them.</p>

<p>The car was uncomfortably crowded and grew more so at
every station; for the next day the new governor was to be
inaugurated at the capital, toward which our train was
leisurely travelling.</p>

<p>I had some difficulty in ethnologically classifying the man
who shared my seat. He was large, the colonel and major
type, although his head was rounder. The features, too,
were of a different cast, his speech less refined and his manners
less gentle.</p>

<p>He wore a broad, new hat, his hair was long, curling
slightly, and he had an air of special importance, the cause
of which I discovered later.</p>

<p>“I wonder why they are treating those poor fellows so
roughly,” I audibly soliloquized, turning to him. He was
studying a typewritten document and evidently did not relish
the interruption.</p>

<p>“Is that any of your business?” he asked, punctuating the
short sentence with a liberal supply of oaths.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have no other business,” I replied. “I travel<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
about the world trying to find out why we people treat one
another as we do, if we happen to be of different races.”</p>

<p>“What kind of business is that?” looking up from his
manuscript and regarding me suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “we call that ‘Social Psychology.’”</p>

<p>“That’s a new graft,” he replied with a laugh. “How
much is there in it?”</p>

<p>“A little money and a great deal of joy,” I said with an
answering smile.</p>

<p>Then he folded his manuscript and made ready to find out
more about my “graft,” which I proceeded to explain.</p>

<p>“You see, from the beginning, when a man saw another
who wasn’t just like him, he said: ‘Will he kill me or shall
I kill him?’ Then they both went about finding out. The
man who survived regarded himself as the greater man, and
his descendants belonged to the superior race.</p>

<p>“We haven’t gone much beyond that point,” I continued.
“We hide our primitive hate under what we proudly call
race prejudice or patriotism, but it’s the old, unchanged fear
and dislike of the unlike, and we act very much as the savages
did who may have lived here before the glaciers ploughed
up your State and helped to manufacture the coal you are
now digging.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you,” I went on, “but I am pretty sure
that you feel mean toward those poor ‘Dagoes’ just because
you want to assert your superiority.</p>

<p>“I have discovered that a man isn’t quite happy unless he
can feel himself superior to something, and these mountain
folk of yours take those mangy, hungry looking dogs along
just so they can have something to kick. Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, clearing his throat and straightening
himself, while into his eyes came a steel-like coldness, “you
don’t mean to say that we are not superior to these Dagoes,
these Black Hand murderers?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not ready to say that yet; but tell me about
them. Whom did they kill, and how?”</p>

<p>Then he told me the story and he knew it well, for he
was a re-elected State official now going to be sworn in.<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
There was a coal miners’ strike&mdash;rather a chronic disease in
that somewhat lawless State&mdash;and the militia was called out.
Violence begat violence, and one of the militiamen, standing
guard at night, was killed by a bullet, fired from a Winchester
rifle at an approximately certain distance.</p>

<p>The Italians were found at that place the next day, were
arrested, and were now on their way to the county seat to
be tried.</p>

<p>My companion evidently had found my “graft” interesting,
for he permitted me to interview the Italians.</p>

<p>None of them knew definitely of what crime they were
accused, and all, of course, protested their innocence.</p>

<p>None of them had served as soldiers and all said they
were unacquainted with the use of firearms.</p>

<p>When we reached the end of the road where we were all
admonished to change cars and not forget our parcels, the
officer graciously allowed me to make an experiment. The
men were freed from their shackles, and I told them that a
high and mighty official was watching them and that the
best marksman of the group would find favor in his sight.
They were then in turn given the Winchester rifle, which
they handled as if it were a pickaxe. They did not know how
to load it, and after it was loaded for them and I asked them
to fire, they fell upon their knees and begged to be permitted
to show their prowess with a stiletto, the use of
which they understood. Within twenty-four hours additional
testimony was furnished, which proved beyond doubt that
the Italians were not implicated in the crime with which
they were charged.</p>

<p>I felt deeply grateful to the man who permitted me to
intervene in their behalf; but what would have happened if
by chance, or the power we call Providence, I had not been
thrown into the sphere of their suffering? Undoubtedly they
would have been convicted of murder and paid the penalty
for a crime which they never committed.</p>

<p>Not only is ignorance of our laws and language a fruitful
cause of the delinquency of immigrants and their children,
but the venality of police officials, the condition of our<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
courts and prisons, not only fail to inspire respect, but contribute
much to the development of those criminal tendencies
with which nature has, to a degree, endowed all men....</p>

<p>Fortunately, I left the county jail with no thirst for blood;
but with a fiercer passion to right the wrongs under which
men suffer, and that, I think, was my one purpose in life
when the prison door closed behind me.</p>

<p><span id="Page_105" class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">INDUSTRIALISM AND THE IMMIGRANT</h3>

<p>We talk much about the American home, which is even
yet the basis of national well-being, although many of its
functions are abrogated. The home still determines the
good or ill of the child, and through him the good or ill of
the nation. Yet we permit millions of people to work, with
no chance to make a real home.</p>

<p>Children there will be, Nature sees to that; but what kind
of children can be begotten in our slums?</p>

<p>The slums in America are as much a national disgrace as
they are a national menace. The gunmen of New York
were bred in hovels which even the home-making genius of
the Jewish people could not turn into homes, or make fit for
the training of children to decent living.</p>

<p>You who go slumming to see the sights, and turn up your
sensitive noses at the bad smells, and your eyes to heaven,
thanking God that you “are not as other men,” must not
forget that the vast majority of our foreign-born workers are
compelled to live as they do by economic and social forces,
which they cannot control.</p>

<p>You remain ignorant of the brave struggles for the home,
and the heroic stand for virtue behind those sooty walls. You
know nothing of the fear of God, the desire to obey His law,
and the love of their country, which filters in to those receptive
souls.</p>

<p>The growth and power of the I. W. W., a revolutionary
organization of the most radical type, anti-national, anti-religious,
repudiating God and State with horrifying blasphemy,
were made possible by the fact that our industrial leaders,
our so-called “hard-headed business men,” have the hard
spot in their hearts and a very soft spot in their heads.</p>

<p>Of all the blind men I have met, the blindest are those farsighted
ones who see wealth in everything, and every common
bush aflame with gold, and see nothing else. Blind
they are to their own larger good, blind to the nation’s needs,<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
blind to the signs of the times. The social weal of our
country is in the hands of the most unsocial....</p>

<p>As I analyze my own relation to the nation of which I
am as much a part as if I had been born under its flag, I
find that it rests itself upon the feeling of gratitude. Not for
the bread I eat, for I had bread enough in my native country;
not for the comfort of home, for I had fair comforts before
I came; not even for liberty and democracy as abstractions,
or even as embodied in the State; for I have found that
freedom is within, and democracy a matter of attitude towards
one’s fellows.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the chance I have had here to develop
unhampered my own self, for a certain largeness of vision
which I think I would not have developed anywhere else; for
the richness which a broad, unhindered contact with all sorts
and conditions of men has brought into my life.</p>

<p>There is something more than gratitude in my heart now.
There is a larger sense of the values I received which I have
not yet appropriated. There is in my heart a sublime passion
for America. Would it have grown into the burning
flame it is, if I had always worked in New York’s sweat-shops?</p>

<p>If I had been beaten by New York’s police? If I had
reared my family in a tenement, and had to send my children
to work when they should have played and studied?</p>

<p>If I had known America only through her yellow journalism,
and sensed her spirit only in ward elections? I do not
know.</p>

<p>What has kept me from becoming an Anarchist, from being
jailed or hanged for leading mobs against their despoilers,
God alone knows. His guidance is as unquestioned as it is
mysterious. There were disclosed to me, early in my career,
in some strange way, the spiritual values latent here. In
spite of the gross, granite-like materialism at the top, I discovered
the richness of the heritage left by the fathers of this
Republic; in spite of the poverty and hardship in which I
had to share, I saw here the fine quality of its vision; in
spite of the crudeness of its blundering ways, all the love a<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
man may have for a country grew in my heart, and changed
only in growing stronger. Yet I am not in the mood to call
to account those toilers whose patriotism is less fervent than
mine and whose ideals are still held in check by the “stomach
line.”</p>

<p>Editors and preachers, teachers and capitalists, with all
the loud if not mighty host of us who are yammering about
the want of patriotism among the masses, and the weakness
of our national spirit; we are the first who must move a notch
higher in our love of country and above the “stomach line.”
We must make real the spiritual ideals for which this country
stands, or at least try to realize them, before we can teach the
alien and his children, or even our own, the meaning of liberty
and democracy. Before we can ask them to die for our country
we shall have to learn to live for it, and the definite task
we have before us is not the mere idolatry of our flag, or the
making of shard and shell.</p>

<p>To provide an adequate wage for our men, to so arrange
our industrial order that there shall not be feverish activity
to-day, and idleness, poverty, bread lines and soup kitchens
to-morrow. To make working conditions tolerable, to provide
against accidents and sickness, unemployment and old
age, and to be true to the life about us.</p>

<p>These are national factors, essential to the making of an
effective national state in our industrial age. Capital, in
common with labor, must learn how to lend itself to the
national purpose; for we have come upon a time, or the time
has come upon us, when we must learn how to melt all
classes, all sections and all races into a final unit. This is
the time to touch the hearts and gain the confidence of all
the people by a high regard for all, so that together we may
turn our faces towards our ultimate goal....</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Steel Company of Granite City, Illinois,
one of those remarkable corporations with a soul, whose
business is rooted in the ideal of service, found its foreign
laborers quartered in what was called “Hungry Hollow.”
This company so exemplified the American spirit of fair play
that, when the foreign employees were aroused to proper civic<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
pride, they rebaptized “Hungry Hollow” into “Lincoln
Place,” because Lincoln’s spirit was manifested towards them.</p>

<p>The Lincoln Progressive Club, as they named their organization,
has as its immediate aim the study of the English
language, and Americanization.</p>

<p>I wish there might be erected in every industrial center a
statue of Abraham Lincoln for masters and men to see and
reverence, thus being reminded of their duty towards each
other and towards their common country.</p>

<p>What a people we could become if the immortal words he
spoke were graven upon the pedestal of such a statue, “With
malice towards none, with charity towards all,” ... to greet
our eyes daily, and to challenge our conduct.</p>

<p>The history of the United States since the Civil War has
not yet been written, for it is the story of an epoch just closing.
It marks the sudden leaping of a people into wealth,
if not into power; the fabulous growth of cities, the end of
the pioneer stage, the beginning of an industrial period, and
the pressure of economic and social problems towards their
solution.</p>

<p>At least twenty millions of people have come full grown
into our national life from the steerage, the womb out of
which so many of us were born into this newer life. Most of
us came to build and not to destroy; we came as helpers and
not exploiters; we brought virtues and vices, much good and
ill, and that, not because we belonged to this or the other national
or racial group, but because we were human.</p>

<p>It is as easy to prove that our coming meant the ill of the
nation as that it meant its well-being. To appraise this fully
is much too early; it is a task which must be left to our children’s
children, who will be as far removed from to-day’s
scant sympathies as from its overwhelming prejudices.</p>

<p>The great war has swung us into the current of world
events, and it ought to bring us a larger vision of the forces
and processes which shape the nations and make their peoples.
As yet we are thinking hysterically rather than historically,
and the indications are that we may not learn anything, nor
yet unlearn, of which we have perhaps the greater need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>Thus far we have become narrower rather than broader,
for the feeling towards our alien population is growing daily
less generous, and our treatment of it less wise.</p>

<p>Nor am I sure in what wisdom consists; the situation is
complex; for we are the Balkan with its national, racial and
religious contentions. We are Russia with its Ghetto, its
Polish and Finnish problem. We are Austria and Hungary
with their linguistic and dynastic difficulties. We are Africa
and Asia; we are Jew and Gentile; we are Protestant and
Greek, and Roman Catholic. We are everything out of
which to shape the one thing, the one nation, the one people.</p>

<p>Yet I am sure that we cannot teach these strangers the
history of their adopted country, and make it their own, unless
we teach them that our history is theirs as well as ours,
and that their traditions are ours, at least as far as they
touch humanity generally, and convey to all men the blessings
which come from the struggle against oppression and superstition.</p>

<p>In their inherited, national prejudices, in their racial hates,
in their tribal quarrels, we wish to have no share, except as
we hope to help them forget the old world hates in the new
world’s love.</p>

<p>None of us who have caught a vision of what America may
mean to the world wish to perpetuate here any one phase of
Europe’s civilization or any one national ideal.</p>

<p>Although our institutions are rooted in English history,
though we speak England’s language and share her rich heritage
of spiritual and cultural wealth, we do not desire to be
again a part of England, or nourish here her ideals of an
aristocratic society.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that for nearly three hundred years a
large part of our population has been German, and that our
richest cultural values have come from Germany, in spite of
her marvellous resources in science, commerce and government,
we do not care to become German, and I am sure that
Americans of German blood or birth would be the first to
repudiate it, should Germany’s civilization threaten to fasten
itself upon us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>We do not wish to be Russian, in spite of certain values
inherent in the Slavic character, nor do we desire to be
French.</p>

<p>We do crave to be an American people&mdash;and develop here
an American civilization; but if we are true to the manifold
genius of our varied peoples, we may develop here a civilization,
richer and freer than any of these, based upon all of
them, truly international and therefore American.</p>

<p>Historians tell us that the history of the United States
illumines and illustrates the historic processes of all ages and
all people.</p>

<p>To this they add the disconcerting prophecy that we are
drifting towards the common goal, and that our doleful
future can be readily foretold. We have had our hopeful
morning, our swift and brilliant noon, and now the dark and
gruesome end threatens us.</p>

<p>I will not believe this till I must.</p>

<p>I will not, dare not lose the hope that we can make this
country to endure firmly, to weather the storm, or at least
put off the senility of old age to the last inevitable moment.</p>

<p>When, however, the end comes, as perhaps it must, I pray
that we may project our hopes and ideals upon the last page
of our history, so that it may read thus: This was a state,
the first to grow by the conquest of nature, and not of nations.
Here was developed a commerce based upon service, and not
upon selfishness; a religion centering in humanity and not in
a church.</p>

<p>Here was maintained sovereignty without a sovereign, and
here the people of all nations grew into one nation, held together
by mutual regard, not by the force of law.</p>

<p>Here the State was maintained by the justice, confidence
and loyalty of its people, and not by battleships and armaments.
When it perished, it was because the people had lost
faith in God and in each other.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">GEORGE A. GORDON</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Old South Church, Boston, has had a prominent and patriotic
part in American history since early days. It was a Puritan immigrant
and layman of this church, Samuel Sewall, who was one of
the first to speak out against human slavery in his tract, “The Selling
of Joseph”; and it was in this church that the five patriotic addresses,
published in 1917 under the title, “The Appeal of the Nation,”
were delivered by George Angier Gordon, pastor of the
church since 1884. The Rev. Dr. Gordon, who was born in Scotland
in 1853 and received his common school education there, came
to the United States in 1871. In 1881 he obtained the degree A.B.
from Harvard. He has since served his Alma Mater frequently in
the capacity of University preacher, and many Harvard men will
recall his inspiring talks in the college chapel. In the following
selection he manifests the poignant homesickness, the sterling loyalty,
and the noble aspiration so common in the writings of the immigrant.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_112" class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>


<h3>THE FOREIGN-BORN AMERICAN CITIZEN:
COST, PRIVILEGE AND DUTIES OF HIS
CITIZENSHIP</h3>

<p>The Republic of the United States is in fact a nation of
immigrants, a nation of aliens. All have made the great
migration, all have come hither from other parts of the
earth. The only difference among Americans is that some
came earlier while others came much later, indeed as it were
yesterday, to these shores. The only aboriginal American
is the Indian. This historic fact should be forever borne in
mind. We came hither first or last, across the ocean, and
from the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>There is however a ground of distinction among Americans;
they are rightly divided into native citizens and citizens
foreign-born. The native citizen has grown into the being
of the society that his alien ancestors helped to form. He
has in his blood an American inheritance; his instincts have
been fed with native food; he is alive to nothing else as he
is to the American Republic. We foreign-born Americans
acknowledge his distinction, we rejoice in his happiness, we
count ourselves fortunate to stand with him in the great communion
of free citizens. We ask him, in his turn, to read in
the story of our migration the struggle of his ancestors; we
remind him of what we left behind, what we brought with
us, and at what cost we gained our American citizenship.</p>

<p>In the words that I have chosen as my text<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> we have a
foreign-born Roman citizen. Exactly where he was born we
do not know; we do know that he was born outside Roman
citizenship. He was, therefore, an adopted citizen of the
Roman Empire, and to this he refers in the words that I
have quoted, “With a great sum obtained I this citizenship.”</p>

<p>There are three implications in these words: the cost of
citizenship to this man; the privilege of citizenship to him;<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
his duty as a Roman citizen. These three points will be a
convenient guide to us in our discussion of the subject of the
morning&mdash;“The Foreign-born American Citizen.”</p>

<p>1. First of all, then, there is the cost to this man of citizenship
in the Roman Empire. He obtained it with a great
sum; to get it made him poor.</p>

<p>There are few among native-born American citizens who
understand the sacrifice made by the foreign-born citizens of
the heritage of childhood and boyhood in the wonder world
of early life. There is the bereavement of the early mystic,
unfathomable touch of nature that comes to one only through
one’s native land. Never again to see the sun rise and set over
the dear old hills, with the hero’s mantle like the bloom of
the heather resting upon them, and the shadow of an immemorial
race, is truly a great bereavement. Never again to
see the green pastures, with the flocks quietly feeding in
them, under the shade of the plot of trees here and there
mercifully provided by the humanity of previous generations,
nor to hear the music of the river that has sung into being
and out of being forty generations of human lives; never again
to see the fields covered with corn, nor to hear the reaper’s
song among the yellow corn; never again to see the light that
welcomed you when you were born, that smiled on you when
you were baptized, that went with you to school, that
watched your play, that constituted the beautiful, the glorious
environment of your early days; never again to hear the song
of the native birds, the skylark in the morning, the mavis at
nightfall, and the wild whistle of the blackbird under the
heat of noon from his thorny den,&mdash;all this is simply inexpressible
bereavement. Nature is inwoven with the soul in
its earliest years; its beauty, its wildness, its soul becomes
part of the soul of every deep-hearted human being, and
never again can nature be seen as she was seen through the
wonder of life’s morning.</p>

<p>It is this spell of nature over the young soul that gives its
exquisite pathos to Hood’s world-familiar melody:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“I remember, I remember,
</div><div class="indent1">The house where I was born,
</div><div class="indent0">The little window where the sun
</div><div class="indent1">Came peeping in at morn;
</div><div class="indent0">He never came a wink too soon.
</div><div class="indent1">Nor brought too long a day,
</div><div class="indent0">But now I often wish the night
</div><div class="indent1">Had borne my breath away!
</div></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">...
</div></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“I remember, I remember,
</div><div class="indent1">The fir trees dark and high;
</div><div class="indent0">I used to think their slender tops
</div><div class="indent1">Were close against the sky:
</div><div class="indent0">It was a childish ignorance,
</div><div class="indent1">But now ’tis little joy
</div><div class="indent0">To know I’m farther off from heav’n
</div><div class="indent1">Than when I was a boy.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>There it is, the mystic, divine influence of nature through
the atmosphere of the country of one’s birth; every immigrant
to this country makes that great surrender.</p>

<p>There is, too, the early humanity. You go down town,
you who are native-born American citizens, and every day
you meet those whom you have known from birth, your
earliest playmates and schoolmates, and those who went to
college with you, who entered business with you, who fought
side by side with you through the Great War, who loved
what you loved in early life, revered what you revered,
laughed at what you laughed at and felt as you felt over the
glory and the tenderness of existence. You do not know what
they have left behind them who never see a face that they
knew in childhood, who will never meet again, till time is no
more, a schoolmate or an early companion, who will never
gather again in the old home with father and mother and
brothers and sisters; only the most favored have had a
fugitive glance, like looking at a telegraph pole from an
express train, of those dear, early faces. There is a whole
world of bereavement of early, tender, beautiful humanity on<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
the part of all who come here. And this again you hear in
those two verses in “Auld Lang Syne”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“We twa hae run about the braes,
</div><div class="indent1">And pu’d the gowans fine,
</div><div class="indent0">But we’ve wander’d monie a weary foot
</div><div class="indent1">Sin’ auld lang syne.
</div></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“We twa hae paidl’d in the burn
</div><div class="indent1">From morning sun till dine,
</div><div class="indent0">But seas between us braid hae roar’d
</div><div class="indent1">Sin’ auld lang syne.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>There is due other surrender: there is the suffering of adjustment
in a new country. The first year I spent in Boston,
from July, 1871, to considerably more than July, 1872, I
conceived my condition to be as near that of the spirits in
hell as anything I could well imagine! To be in a city
where nobody knew you, where you knew nobody, where so
many wanted to take advantage of the “greenhorn,” to laugh
at him if he ever grew for a moment a bit sentimental, was
not exactly heaven. Many and many a time I went down to
the wharf to see the ships with their white sails, written all
over with invisible tidings from the far, sunny islands left
behind, and if I had not been restrained by shame and pride I
should have gone home. That is the experience of Scandinavian,
English, Scotch, Irish, Teuton, Slav, Armenian,
Syrian, and Latin; the great bereavement of nature and of
early humanity is deepened by the sorrow of readjustment in
a foreign land. “With a great sum obtained we this citizenship”;
few understand it, few indeed. Foreign-born American
citizenship is preceded by a vast sacrifice, and you never
can understand that sort of citizenship till you take account
of this really profound experience.</p>

<p>2. The next thing in the experience of the chief captain
was his privilege as a Roman citizen. His station and bearing
and power told of that privilege. He was a military
tribune in the legion stationed in Jerusalem; he had risen to<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
important command and power impossible for him, inaccessible
to him if he had not obtained citizenship.</p>

<p>America has been called the land of opportunity. Look at
this fact in three directions only, since time will not allow
more. The common workman may become, by intelligence, by
diligence and by fidelity, the master workman. Cast your eyes
over the land to-day and assemble the master workmen, and
you will find that the vast majority of them have risen from
the position of ordinary workmen to the chief places in their
trade and calling. Such a chance for ascension in a broad
way for all competent men, in the Old World, is a simple
impossibility. The chance does not exist there. Men rise
there by talent and by luck, by talent and by favoritism. But
here in a broad and magnificent manner they rise by talent
and industry, fidelity and force; here as nowhere else, they
have a chance to work out what is in them.</p>

<p>Consider this in the things of the intellect. The Old
World calls us an uneducated race. It is true that we have
not many great scholars; the reason is that we are engaged
with immediate pressing problems; we apply intelligence to
living issues which in other lands is applied to the Genitive
and the Accusative and the Dative cases of the Latin and
Greek languages. When we look backward and consider the
provision made for the intellect of the nation during the last
fifty years, we claim that there is no parallel to it in any
country on which the sun shines. More money has gone to
found colleges and schools and universities for men and for
women, open to all talent from ocean to ocean and from the
Canadian border to the Gulf, than was ever dedicated to
education in the same length of time in the history of mankind.
Not only is there provision for the regulars, but also
for the irregulars; all sorts of evening schools flourish in our
cities where the first teachers of the community are available
for talented and aspiring youth of slender means. Men are
practicing medicine and law; they are in the ministry and in
other professions, usually called learned, who never saw the
inside of a college or a university, who have obtained an education
in what is called an irregular way, from and by the<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
very men who are teaching in these regular academic institutions.</p>

<p>Let me remind you of the abundant hospitality, the wonderful
generosity of the American people toward aspiring
youth. Talent which would be ignored in Great Britain,
promise which would be sneered at in every continental
country in Europe, is here discovered and encouraged to develop
into power. This is a phenomenon of which we must
never lose sight, the chance here in the United States for a
man to be intellectually all that it is possible for him to be.
The best teachers may often be seen here wielding the educational
power of history and the arts to train the youth to
whom college is an impossibility, for service requiring educated
powers, in his day and generation.</p>

<p>There is to be noted the opportunity in the way of character
and moral influence that comes to citizens of the United
States. What does that mean? The chance to change and
improve the law of the land, the chance for a man to change
and improve the government of the United States, the
chance to modify, in the line of humanity, the social feeling
of the United States. And freedom is here the condition of
all; every man who complains that things are not what they
should be has a chance by his vote to remedy the abuse and to
take another step toward the ideal.</p>

<p>Here again there is something new, measuring it against
the whole people. We are dupes and fools when we allow
ourselves to be ruled by groups in this country; we are free
men, with the power in our hands. If we have moral ideals
of our own, and moral character, we can so use them as to
lift the character of the land in which we live.</p>

<p>3. Finally, there was the duty of the tribune as a Roman
citizen. Paul was about to be bound and tortured, without
trial, when he appealed to the chief captain, “Is it lawful for
you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned?”
This startled the man. “Tell me, art thou a Roman? Good
heavens, this will never do! I am pledged to do my duty!
Get off those shackles and set the man free and guard his
life!” There was the man’s sense of his duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>What is the duty of foreign-born American citizens?
First to learn the English language and to prefer it to all
other tongues on the face of the earth. That tongue comes
in the splendor of a June day; it breaks over life like a June
sunrise, with an atmosphere, tone, beauty, and power which
for Americans must ever be unapproachable. Let no American
citizen hug his foreign tongue, go into the closet with it
and shut out the light of the great English language which
carries all our ideals as Americans! The very vessel of the
Lord it is, in which American freedom is carried,&mdash;the language
of Shakespeare and Milton, the incomparable free man;
the language of Bacon and Burke and Washington and Hamilton
and Webster and Lincoln. This tongue consecrates the
immigrant who would be a citizen; he never can be a citizen
of the United States without that, never. This is the tongue
that carries in a unique translation the literature of Israel;
the Bible is the maker of free peoples.</p>

<p>Next, we foreign-born American citizens must read the
story of the Revolution into our blood. What is the significance
of the Revolution for the foreign-born American citizen?
These men were Englishmen or the sons of Englishmen;
they loved the British Isles better than any portion of
the earth’s surface, except their own Colonies; they loved
them with an inexpressible love. Yet when it came to question
of principle they stood out and said, “We must be free;
the Colonies, or the United States, first!” You recall Daniel
Webster’s splendid eloquence here:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On this question of principle, while actual suffering was
yet afar off, they raised their flag against a power to which,
for purposes of foreign conquest and subjection, Rome in the
height of her glory is not to be compared,&mdash;a power which
has dotted over the surface of the whole globe with her possessions
and military posts, whose morning drumbeat, following
the sun, and keeping company with the hours, circles the
earth with one continuous and unbroken strain of the martial
airs of England.”</p>

<p>Against that power to which they were as nothing, against
that lovely land of their origin they stood out when it was<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
a question of their own independence and their own manhood.</p>

<p>That applies to every foreign-born American citizen to-day,&mdash;Saxon,
Celt, Scandinavian, Teuton, Slav, Latin,
Syrian, bond and free. Learn the lesson of the Revolution.
This country will have no hands upon it, from any origin,
anywhere outside of itself. Learn the lesson of the Civil
War; the nation that set to work to keep its integrity as a
political whole, to keep its integrity as a human whole, to
fight, as it had done a foreign dominion, an evil genius inside
its own border. There again is a vast lesson to all of us who
are foreign-born. Once again we should store in memory
and ponder in clearest conscience and intelligence the great
ideas, the great political ideas of America as they are exhibited
in Washington, in Hamilton the Nationalist and in Jefferson
the State Rights’ patriot; and again in Webster and
Calhoun, in Lincoln and the Confederate, and as they issued
at last in a true conception of State freedom in a sisterhood
of States that constitutes a great nation. These things should
be part of the common store of knowledge of the adopted
citizen. They are the great forces that have moved this
country from its earliest beginning, and that have lifted it
into power and renown.</p>

<p>America must be first; cherish your love for the old country,
your tenderness,&mdash;a man does not need to hate his mother
because he loves his wife, but it is his duty to stand by his
wife even against his mother. What kind of a country should
we have if every citizen, when trouble comes, should prefer
in loyalty the land of his birth! What a confused mob of a
country we should have! Duty overrides origin, tradition,
sentiment. Here and here alone is our supreme and inviolable
obligation.</p>

<p>I often think that this great country of ours is ultimately
to be the deepest-hearted and the brightest-minded nation of
the world. Hither come, with sore hearts, burdened humanity
and quickened intelligence, the elect from all nations. You
look at them when they land, and you laugh. If you had
been in Quebec when I landed, perhaps you would not have<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
wanted me as your minister! The elect from all nations,
parts of a splendid orchestra,&mdash;violin, flute, cornet, drum,
trumpet, and a score of other instruments, all pouring forth
their genius to make the great, swelling, soul-stirring symphony
of this mighty nation. Thus from Scandinavia, Germany,
France, Italy, Russia, Armenia, Greece; from England,
Ireland, and Scotland they come,&mdash;all are here with
great souls to make a new and greater America. Out of this
composite land, this Pentecostal nation,&mdash;sometimes it seems
to me minus the Holy Ghost,&mdash;this nation gathered from
every people under the heaven, rags and tatters and dirt and
all, I believe the Eternal Spirit will evolve and establish the
most gifted, the most far-shining and the mightiest people in
the world. God grant that our dream may come true!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SERAPHIM G. CANOUTAS</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>An American Greek who has traveled extensively throughout the
United States, and has mingled freely with his people and therefore
understands their aspirations and needs, is Seraphim G. Canoutas,
member of the Boston Bar and author of the “Greek-American
Guide” and the “Adviser for Greeks in America.”</p>

<p>The following plain recital of Mr. Canoutas’s struggle and
achievement is worthy of presentation here, because it shows that
what the immigrant seeks for in America he may find, and that
back of real success and contentment lies the will to serve. He says
in a letter to the editor:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I arrived in this country fifteen years ago, and my hardships
during the first five to seven years cannot be briefly told. Still, I
am glad that I have suffered so much. I was born in a little village
of Greece, in 1873 or 1874; I do not know the exact date of
my birth. There were no records kept in those days, and my parents
were illiterate. There was no school in the little village; no
church either. I went to school to another village at a distance of
about three miles. I do not know how I managed to go to what
they call Gymnasium in Greece, and finally to the University at
Athens&mdash;a very uncommon thing for a poor peasant’s son. I graduated
from the University of Athens, Law Department, in 1898, and
in 1899 I received my license to practise law. But a poor young
man in those days had no chance whatever to get any clients in Greece,
except by selling his conscience and his principles to some politician.
I left Greece immediately after my admission to the bar and settled
in Constantinople, Turkey, where I started to practise law before
the Consular Court of Greece. (Each nation maintains separate
courts for its citizens or subjects in Turkey.) I practised law there
for over five years and was doing very well. But I wanted to see
other countries; there was something there which I did not like. I
went to France, Italy, Austria, and at last I decided to come to
America. When I arrived in America, I found myself wholly discouraged.
Nobody could give me advice what to do. There were
very few educated Greeks, fifteen years ago, in this country, and
they did not know how to help others; they rather discouraged me.
I knew not a word of English; but, knowing French, I managed to
learn some English in a few months. Two years after my arrival
I started to write a book for the new immigrants under the title of
‘Greek-American Guide,’ giving them as much information about
the country as I knew. But books do not pay. Although everybody
appreciated the usefulness of my book, the purchasers were very few.</p>

<p>“In 1909 to 1910 I made a trip all over the United States and<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
Canada to gather information about my countrymen from personal
experience. Finally I met a good American who told me how I
could study law in this country and be admitted to the bar. In 1912
I was admitted to the bar in Boston, and have practised law since;
but I like social work better than law. I have continued to
lecture to Greeks throughout this State and in New England; and
I feel a great satisfaction that I have been able to do some good for
my countrymen, as well as for my adopted country, which offers the
greatest opportunities to everybody, although it takes a long time
for a foreigner to find out.”</p>

<p>In 1918 Mr. Canoutas published his “Hellenism in America,” dedicating
the book “to the Greeks in America in general, but those
serving under the glorious American flag in particular ... in perpetual
remembrance of their devotion to our beloved country and
their heroic sacrifices for the cause of democracy.” From this volume
the following sensible advice on Americanization is quoted.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_123" class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>


<h3>AMERICANIZATION: ITS PRINCIPLES AND
MEANING</h3>

<p>It was a wrong practice, in my opinion, and against the
principles of true democracy, for certain Americans to induce
foreigners to become American citizens quickly if they wished
“to make more money and to get better jobs.” Because love
of mere money and better jobs, above all other things, leads
to materialism, plutocracy, bureaucracy and aristocracy, and
not to true democracy.</p>

<p>Candidates for admission to citizenship of a democratic
country should be taught to understand and appreciate the
superiority and the beauty of its democratic principles instead
of being promised “better jobs and more money.”<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>When a man or woman is inspired by those high and
noble ideas and principles stated in the Declaration of Independence,
and repeated by such unselfish and magnanimous
heads of a Republic as Lincoln and Wilson, and feels them
and applies them, we can say that person has been influenced
by Americanism or is Americanized. But unfortunately
a tendency prevails lately to confuse the word “Americanization”
with the word “naturalization.” There is nothing
more erroneous than to consider every naturalized person
as Americanized, or to accept as a general proposition that a
person not naturalized cannot be Americanized. Naturalization
is simply a matter of form, while Americanization refers
to a person’s heart and soul and mind. A naturalized
American citizen who has not been inspired by the lofty
principles which Americanism stands for, but who has been
induced to acquire American citizenship for some material
profit, bears the same relation to the State as a hypocrite
bears to the Church. For this reason I have always been
astonished to hear Americans, even among the best statesmen
and educators, encouraging wholesale naturalization before<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
they become sure of the Americanization of the applicants.
What has the State or the nation to gain from the man who
is induced by the petty politician to become a citizen because
it pays? What has the State to profit by me, for instance,
for being an American citizen if I am not Americanized?
On the contrary, it is dangerous, because in a serious crisis,
like the present one, I may use my citizenship as a shield in
defence of my un-American conduct. Common sense therefore
requires that the foreigner should not be given that powerful
weapon before we are sure that he will use it in defending
his fellow-citizens and American institutions, and not in
destroying them.</p>

<p>Prudence requires us to educate the foreigner and thoroughly
Americanize him, if he appreciates Americanism, before
admitting him to citizenship. But this education and
Americanization cannot be carried out successfully by words
or preaching alone. We must show to the foreigners by our
example, by acts and deeds, that we ourselves stand for Americanism
and apply the American ideals in our daily life, in our
every-day contact with foreigners.</p>

<p>If Americans look down with contempt upon the immigrant,
because he is poor, uneducated, or cursed with certain
faults which he acquired while living in a poor or ill-governed
country, they cannot make him believe that America stands
for democracy, justice and general brotherhood....</p>

<p>When Americans, in their struggle to instruct the foreigners,
have acquired for their own part a better knowledge
of the characteristics of each race, when they rightly attribute
the faults of foreigners to the painful conditions under which
they lived in their own country, when they patiently bring to
light the better qualities of those whom they aspire to educate,
then that unity so desirable, so necessary for this great nation,
will be perfected. Then there will be no more “foreigners,”
but all races will be one people, offering their best efforts to
the land in which they have equal obligations and equal
rights.</p>

<p>That one should come to America for the sole purpose of making
money, as the author of the following selection frankly states he did,
may seem an unworthy motive; but, after all, it is not essentially
different from the impulse that causes the country-bred American
boy to seek the larger cities for what he thinks will be greater
financial opportunities. Motives, in the final analysis, must be
judged in large part by their issues and results.</p>

<p>This young Italian, ambitious to become a lawyer and finding it
impossible in Italy to get employment with an opportunity to study,
decided to try his luck in America, where he was willing to “shovel
coal,” “wash dishes,” or “do anything to get up.” In a little more
than five years after landing at Ellis Island he was admitted to the
New York bar.</p>

<p>The following selection is reprinted from his article, “America as
a Place to Make Money,” published in the issue of <cite>The World’s
Work</cite> for December, 1920.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_126" class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>


<h3>SOME OBSTACLES TO AMERICANIZATION</h3>

<p>I was about twenty years old when I first thought of going
to America. But it is not so easy to leave one’s native land:
it was not until three years later that I said good-by to my
father and mother and our neighbors. I did not think for a
moment that it was for the last time&mdash;I was only going to
America to make money and then return to Baiano and the
old folks.</p>

<p>My father gave me a little money so that I could buy a
second-class ticket. But I was young; I was starting on my
first big adventure; and&mdash;in Naples my money went, this
way, that way&mdash;I came in the steerage. It was no great
hardship. My fellow-passengers were Italians, most of them
laborers, men used to hard work. They were very happy&mdash;laughing,
singing, playing&mdash;full of dreams, ambitions.</p>

<p>Then came Ellis Island!</p>

<p>Every one crowded&mdash;discomfort&mdash;lice&mdash;dirt&mdash;harshness&mdash;the
officers shouting “Come here,” “Go there,” as though they
were driving animals. And then the uncertain period of detention&mdash;sometimes
a week, sometimes two, three, or even
four weeks&mdash;it is as though a man were in prison. Ellis
Island does not give the immigrant a good first lesson in
Americanization.</p>

<p>America wants the immigrant as a worker; but does it
make any effort to direct him, to distribute him to the places
where workers are needed? No; it leaves the immigrant to
go here, there, any place. If the immigrant were a horse instead
of a human being, America would be more careful of
him; if it loses a horse, it feels it loses something; if it loses
an immigrant, it feels it loses nothing. At any rate, that is
the way it seems to the immigrant; and it strengthens his
natural disposition to settle among people of his own race.</p>

<p>A man needs to be a fighter to come to America without
friends. I was more fortunate than many: I had a brother
in America. He worked in a private bank. He met me<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
when I landed and took me to his home in Brooklyn. I
looked for a job for about a month. I tried to get work on
the Italian newspapers; I tried to get work in a law office.
Finally a friend took me to a Jewish law office, and I was
employed&mdash;I was to get 25 per cent. of the fees from any
clients that I brought in. I stayed there two months and got
$5. Three months after I arrived in New York I was given
the kind of a place that I had looked for in vain in my native
land&mdash;one that would enable me to support myself and
study my chosen profession. I was given a place on an
Italian religious newspaper. I worked from eight in the morning
to six in the evening, and attended the night course of
the New York Law School.</p>

<p>It was about August when I landed in America, and
already there was election talk. (It was the year McClellan
ran for Mayor.) I met some of the Italian-American politicians.
It is said that I have a gift for oratory. The politicians
asked what would be my price to talk in the Italian
sections of the city. I said that I did not want anything. I
made speeches for McClellan, and I have made speeches in
every campaign since.</p>

<p>That was one of the first things that struck me in America&mdash;that
every one working in politics was working for his
own pocket. Another thing that also amazed me was that
most of the men elected to an office, in which they are supposed
to deliberate and legislate, were in reality only figureheads
taking orders from some one else. They had no independence,
no individuality. Another discovery was that the
Italians with most political influence were men of low morality,
of low type. Then I discovered the reason: the politicians
needed repeaters and guerillas, and that was why “the
boss had to be seen” through a saloon- or dive-keeper.</p>

<p>A thing that seemed very strange was the way the American
newspapers magnified crime in Italian districts, how they
made sensational stories out of what were really little happenings,
how they gave the Italians as a people a character for
criminality and violence. No less strange was the way the
Italian newspapers answered the American press. They were<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
both building up a barrier of prejudice. If I were to judge
America through the American newspapers, I would not
have become an American citizen; or if I could know
America only through the Italian-American newspapers, I
would say that the Americans are our enemies.</p>

<p>It must be frankly admitted, however, that there is a
change in the second generation, a change that is too frequently
not for the better. As I have said, the majority of
Italian immigrants come from the rural districts of Italy,
and, because there is no policy of distribution, most of them
settle in the big cities. They are not prepared to meet the
situation presented in a big industrial centre. They think
to apply the same principle in bringing up children that had
been applied in the little village or on the farm in Italy.
They let the children run loose. And in the streets
of the crowded tenement districts the children see graft,
pocketpicking, street-walking, easy money here, easy money
there; they see the chance to make money without working.
The remedy is to be found in distributing the newly arrived
immigrants.</p>

<p>Most of what I have said has been of the faults of America.
I have spoken of them because they are things that hold
back Americanization.</p>

<p>America has been good to me. I have prospered here as I
could not have prospered in Italy. I came to make money and
return; I have made money and stayed. A little more
than five years after I had landed at Ellis Island
I was admitted to the New York bar. I have already
had greater success than I dreamed, when I left Italy,
that I should have. And I look forward to still greater success.
For me, America has proved itself, and promises to
continue to prove itself, the land of opportunity, but I have
not forgotten Italy&mdash;it is foolish to tell any Italian to forget
Italy. I say Italy; but for me, as for the others, Italy is the
little village where I was raised&mdash;the little hills, the little
church, the little garden, the little celebrations. I am forty
years old, but Christmas and Easter never come around but
what I want to return to Baiano. In my mind I become a<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
little child again. But I know enough to realize that I see
all those scenes from a distance and with the eye of childhood.</p>

<p>But even if I wanted to return to Italy, my children would
not let me. America is their country. My father is dead. I
have brought my mother here. When an Italian brings his
parents to America, he is here to stay.</p>

<p>America is a wonderful nation. But we make a mistake
if we assume that the Anglo-Saxon is the perfect human being.
He has splendid qualities, but he also has faults. The
same thing is true of the Latins. The Anglo-Saxon is pre-eminently
a business man, an executive, an organizer, energetic,
dogged. But in the Anglo-Saxon’s civilization the
Latin finds a lack of the things that go to make life worth
living. I remember the returned Italians, the “Americans,”
that I used to see at Baiano: they had made money in
America and were prosperous and independent, but they had
also lost something&mdash;a certain light-heartedness, a joy in the
little things&mdash;the old jests no longer made them laugh. The
Latin has the artistic, the emotional temperament, a gift for
making little things put sunshine into life, a gift for the
social graces. If the Latin could get the qualities that the
Anglo-Saxon has, and give to the Anglo-Saxon those that he
lacks,&mdash;if all the nationalities that make up America could
participate in this give-and-take process,&mdash;then we would
have a real Americanization.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Kulamer was born on May 3, 1876, at Spisske Podhradie,
Spisska Zupa, Czecho-Slovak Republic, and came to this country in
1891, alone. In June, 1909, he was admitted to the bar in Allegheny
County, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In an article, entitled “Americanization: the Other Side of the
Case,” contributed to the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>, March, 1920, he says:
“Although born in far-off Czecho-Slovakia, under the shadow of the
snow-capped Tatra, I can without boasting say that I yield to no
one in my loyalty to the Stars and Stripes; and if I differ in my
views as to the methods to be used in Americanizing those who, like
me, were born in other countries, I do it out of love for my adopted
country, and because I am anxious to see these efforts crowned with
success.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kulamer has favored us with the following essay, in which he
further presents his ideas on this subject.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_131" class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>


<h3>THE AMERICAN SPIRIT AND
AMERICANIZATION</h3>

<p>No matter how uncouth in appearance the immigrant when
he sets foot on American soil, the criminal fleeing from the
hands of justice excepted, there burns in his soul an intense
love for the country of his nativity, inherited from generations
of his ancestors; the more primitive his heart, the simpler and
stronger is this love. He may have come to this country only
to earn sufficient money to relieve his wants at home or to enlarge
his means of living, or he may have come here as to a
land of promise of whose great opportunities and larger freedom
he has heard, still his heart remains in the land of his
birth where the ashes of his forefathers are resting and to
which the memories of his happiest childhood days are clinging.
Leaving his home-nest, forsaking friends and family
and turning his face to a strange land to mix with people
whose customs and language he knows not, is a thrilling and
tragic adventure to every immigrant. And it is well that his
soul is so constituted, because he has the capacity to become a
true patriot. Your cosmopolite is of different stuff; he is
callous and incapable of those noble sentiments which urge
the patriot to sacrifice even his life for his country, either of
birth or adoption. A man who pays no homage to any land is
incapable of harboring those feelings of brotherly love and
kinship on which the solidarity of a nation rests. If Americanizers
wish to wean the immigrant from the old to the
new, they must have genuine respect for his feelings and
not wound them; he must be wooed, he cannot be forced.</p>

<p>What is the object of this Americanization which is so
much talked about and on which so much energy and money
is spent? Is it simply to wipe out the difference between the
customs and habits of the older and newer settlers; or is it
to amalgamate the various human elements into one homogeneous
mass, into one nation? If it is the former, it is<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
wasted energy; time will accomplish it. If it is the latter,
then the aliens must be considered as human beings whose
souls are made of the same material as those of the Pilgrim
Fathers. Nations do not appear on the earth spontaneously;
they are the result of historical growth, lasting for centuries.
Many factors exert their influences upon a nation in the
formative stage. Stop immigration, if you can get along without
it, and in another generation the inhabitants of this country
will be such Americans as America will have made them.
If they should not turn out to be true Americans, it will be
America’s fault. Even now the children of alien parents
speak the same language, dress the same way, dance the same
dances, sing the same songs, have the same good qualities and
the same faults as the children whose ancestors came here
sooner. If you want to convert the old folks into Americans,
then it is necessary to handle the situation with tact. Love is
a tender plant; it does not take root easily, and the least inclement
weather will blast it; but it is very sturdy when full
grown, nothing less than a thunderbolt will shatter it. Furthermore,
it is of a spiritual essence, and money cannot buy it.</p>

<p>To succeed in this purpose it is, first of all, necessary to
study each nationality separately. The very fact that all of
them are treated alike is detrimental. It is unfair to class
them all alike. They all have their good and bad qualities;
and justice demands that the latter be not attributed to those
who do not possess them. There is not one nationality that
would admit its inferiority to the others, and every one of
them considers itself equal to, if not better than, many others.
Consequently, to be classed with races looked down upon is a
humiliation to which no one with self-respect will submit
without protest. This is a fact which must not be lost sight
of; it is rooted in human nature. It is further necessary to
study the habits, customs, prejudices and inclinations of every
nationality separately, so that such as are too deeply rooted
may not be violently antagonized.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the matter of language. The Swede or
the Spaniard may not object to being forced by law to learn
English, because in his mother country this question never<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
arose, it did not enter into his daily life. It is different with
the Slovak or the Pole, whose soul was stirred to its very
depths because the Magyar or the Prussian wanted by law to
force a strange tongue on him. It was a tradition with him
to resist such an attempt; he looked upon it as an oppression in
his mother country, and he is likely to look upon it in the
same light here. The conditions in Europe and here may be
different; he may be justified in objecting there and not here;
but his mind is habituated to opposing the ruling powers in
their efforts to force upon him a strange language. A common
workingman is not used to psychological self-analysis or
to studying archæology; he is controlled mainly by his
impulses. He will note only that he is required to submit
here to laws which he considered oppressive and tyrannical in
the old country.</p>

<p>The glories and advantages of this country should not be
fed to the immigrant in excessive doses, but presented tactfully.
He is liable to look upon it as an attempt to humiliate
him, as unwarranted boasting. It is not difficult to pick flaws
in the armor of American complacency. Every man is a hero-worshipper
at heart, and every man has his childhood heroes
to whom he clings. Judged by an absolute standard, if there
is such a standard, the American heroes may stand on a higher
plane; but if rude hands are placed upon the childhood heroes
of the alien he is likely to resent it. The skies are just as
blue, the fields are carpeted just as beautifully with flowers
and the nights are illuminated with the same glorious stars on
the Eastern as on the Western Hemisphere. The majority of
the aliens enjoyed more of these beauties at home than they
do in the mines and smoke-infested atmosphere of the industrial
American cities. It is true that they earn more money
here in dollars and cents; but they work harder for it and
sometimes under the most cruel taskmasters.</p>

<p>Teaching aliens the English language, American customs,
ideals, political institutions and history, will, of course, go a
great way in making them formal Americans, and, in some
cases, it may awaken in them a love for their new home; but
it is indispensably necessary that in their daily contact with<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
the older Americans they see that these ideals are put into
practice. They have a very high idea of Americanism, and
they scrutinize very critically the conduct of the Americans
with whom they come into contact, to see whether it squares
with these ideals. They watch the manner in which the laws
are enforced by the officials, and compare it with the way in
which they are enforced in their native land; and, if they find
out that the Americans do not practice what they preach,
that the administration of public affairs is not essentially different
here from what they know it to be at home, their
opinion of America is not exalted. They look upon all the
loud protestations as bluff and hypocrisy, and no amount of
Americanization work will change their views. They are on
trial here, but they also put the Americans to a test.</p>

<p>This Americanization work must be looked upon as the
molding of human souls. When men’s habits of thought and
action have become fixed by age, when they have lost their
youthful plasticity, to recast their souls into predetermined
molds without subjecting them first to the gentle heat of sympathy
is like forging cold steel into new shapes. It can be
done, but it requires enormous energy and the results are
never as satisfactory as when the steel is first heated into a
flux and then cast.</p>

<p>If Americanization is to accomplish its purpose,&mdash;the amalgamation
of all the races and nationalities that inhabit the
United States into one nation, the transformation of the
aliens into one hundred per cent. Americans,&mdash;if it is to be
beneficial and not harmful, it must be looked upon as a spiritual
regeneration. Naturalization makes a citizen out of an
alien; learning the English language makes him more efficient
both for good and evil; conformity to American habits and
customs wipes out social differences; knowledge of American
institutions and laws enables him to live up to them or to
break them consciously; but none of these nor all combined
will make him an enthusiastic American unless his heart has
been alienated from his mother country and his affections
transferred to his adopted home. Not until the alien will<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
love America above all, not until he will boast of it and
defend its faults, can he be considered a true American. And
he will do neither unless he has placed America above his
mother country in his estimation. This means a re-birth in
his soul.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Social and Religious Life of Italians in America,” by Enrico
C. Sartorio, is written from the viewpoint of one who came as a
foreigner to America when he was already a young man. It aims
to show how a foreigner really feels. In the words of Dean George
Hodges, who writes the Introduction to the book, it “is a timely
revelation of the width and depth of a racial gulf which must first
be bridged and then filled. His suggestions as to the accomplishing
of this necessary work are definite and practical inferences from his
own successful experience.”</p>

School and has since been successfully engaged in pastoral work in

<h3>PATRONIZING THE FOREIGNER</h3>

<p>Among certain people there still exists the old prejudice
that there must be something the matter with a foreigner.
Exclusiveness on one side, loneliness on the other, do not help
to interpret American life in the right spirit to the foreigner.
If educated Italians thus do not know the real America, you
can easily imagine what the immigrant’s conception of
America may be. My barber, who has been in this country
twenty-eight years, was dumbfounded when I told him the
other day that six people out of seven in America are Protestant.
The poor fellow had gone about for twenty-eight years
tipping his hat to every church, thinking that they were all
Roman Catholic churches. I have found over and over again
Italian couples living together in the belief that they were
husband and wife, because they misunderstood American law.
They had been told that in America a civil marriage was as
valid as a religious one, so they went to the City Hall, and by
going through the process of answering questions in taking out
the marriage license, they thought they had been married and
went happily home to live together as husband and wife. An
Italian tried to explain to me the meaning of Thanksgiving
Day. “You see,” he said, “the word explains itself, ‘Tacchins-giving
Day’”; “tacchin” meaning turkey in Italian, it was,
according to this man, the day on which Americans gave away
turkeys.</p>

<p>And what opportunity has an immigrant to know this
country when he sees America only at its worst? Through
the gum-chewing girls whom he meets in factories, through
the hard-drinking and hard-swearing “boss” who orders him
about, through the dubious type of youth whom he meets
at the saloon and in the dance hall, through the descriptions
given in Italian newspapers and by cheap orators he comes
to know America. Add to that poor wages, quarters in the
slums, policemen, car conductors and ushers who laugh at
him when he asks for information, “bosses” who claim a fee<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
for securing him a job, and the sweet names of “Dago” and
“Guinea” by which the supposed American thinks himself entitled
to call him, and you can imagine what a delightful
feeling the average Italian has toward this country.</p>

<p>Where does the fault lie? In prejudice and indifference,
and in the spirit of patronage. Americans who judge by appearances,
who have not travelled in Italy or studied modern
Italian life, scornfully turn away from the Italian immigrant
because he is not as clean-shaven or as well-kempt as the
American workingman. Other Americans do not concern
themselves with foreigners. They have a vague knowledge
that there is somewhere, in some God-forsaken corner of the
city, a foreign population, and that is all. Still others take a
sentimental view of the matter; they have somewhat the feeling
that existed in the bosom of an Irishwoman, a neighbor
of mine. On Saturday night,&mdash;she was always affectionate
on that special night,&mdash;she would wipe her eyes and say,
“Thim poor Eyetalians.” This kind of person means well,
but generally has zeal without knowledge.</p>

<p>A lady of refinement, born in a leading city of Italy, married
to an Italian Protestant minister who is now at the head
of an important religious movement in Italy, one day received
the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Dear Madam</em>:</p>

<p>“We are going to have a bazaar for the benefit of Italians.
Please come to help us, <em>dressed in the national costume that
you used to wear in Italy</em>.”</p></div>

<p>A son of a leading lawyer of Naples came to this country
and was soon holding a fine position and making a good living.
He met at church an American lady, who told him that she
would be very glad to see him the next day at her house. At
the appointed hour our young gentleman went there and
handed his card to the servant. “Oh, yes,” she said, “the
lady gave me something for you,” and she thrust into his
hand a dilapidated suitcase and a note. The note read:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Dear Sir</em>:</p>

<p>“I have been called away suddenly, but my maid will give
you the article which I intended to present to you in asking
you to call. As I no longer have use for this suitcase, perhaps
it would serve you on your next trip to Italy.</p>

<p>“Trusting to see you at church next Sunday,</p>

<p class="ir1 p-1"><span style="padding-right:3em">“Sincerely yours,</span><br />
&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.”</p></div>

<p>On another occasion an Italian minister was sent to a new
field. A few days after he had settled down he had a telephone
call from the wife of a minister of the town, who
invited him to call at her house. At the appointed hour he
went and was met by the servant, who gave him a newspaper
bundle. The young man protested, saying that he had come
to call in response to an invitation. The servant went upstairs,
but came back, saying there was no mistake, that the
lady wished that given to him. On reaching home he found
that the contents consisted of cast-off clothing for his children.
He bought a handsome edition of an Italian book for children,
translated into English, and sent it with his regards to the
patronizing lady.</p>

<p><span id="Page_140" class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>


<h3>TRAINING FOR CITIZENSHIP</h3>

<p>There should be, in the large foreign colonies, organized
lectures, clubs, stereopticon lectures, distribution of information,
both in Italian and in English, to explain and to instruct
in regard to American history, laws, institutions, and ideals.
There should be free courses on a university extension plan
for Italian professional men, with a view to preparing them
to expound to their people in the right way the principles
and standards of American life. A regular and carefully
carried out campaign should be started in the Italian newspapers,
with well-written articles by leading men on the
subject of American life; and a careful censorship of Italian
newspapers should be established to challenge every article
that is unduly depreciatory of America.</p>

<p>Churches should be centres where American volunteers of
the best kind can in deed and word represent their country
to the foreigner. Churches furnish a good means to bring
about Americanization. Italians are apt to move from place
to place, and those who become attached to Evangelical
churches, besides the good which they eventually get in their
own churches, are also brought into contact with American
congregations, who by their example initiate them into the
ways of American life.</p>

<p>A campaign to enlighten the immigrant as to his duties
towards his new country should be started on a somewhat
different basis from those already tried. The immigrant is
often made to feel how great the material advantage is for
him in becoming an American citizen, and thus is trained
to enter into American public and political life in a mercenary
spirit. When I applied for citizenship papers, I received this
letter from the Bureau of Naturalization, Washington,
D.C.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Dear Sir</em>:</p>

<p>“You have just filed your petition for naturalization
to become a citizen of the United States, and because<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
of this the United States Bureau of Naturalization is sending
this letter to you, as it desires to show you how you can become
an American citizen. It also wants to help you to get
a better position that pays you more money for your work.
In order to help you better yourself it has sent your name to
the public schools in your city, and the superintendent of
those schools has promised to teach you the things which you
should know to help you to get a better position. If you will
go to the public school building nearest where you live the
teacher will tell you what nights you can go to school and
the best school for you to go to. You will not be put in a
class with boys and girls, but with grown people. It will
not cost you anything for the teaching which you will receive
in the school, and it will help you get a better job and also
make you able to pass the examination in court when you
come to get your citizen’s papers.</p>

<p>“You should call at the schoolhouse as soon as you receive
this letter so that you may start to learn and be able to get a
better job as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="ir1 p-1"><span style="padding-right:2em">“Very truly yours,</span><br />
N. N.”</p></div>

<p>As you see, four times there occurs in this letter the exhortation
to become a citizen and to learn the English language
in order to get “a better job.” The letter contains not a
single appeal to higher motives nor a reference to the duties
and responsibilities of American citizenship, yet it is sent to
every foreigner who applies for citizenship. I think a letter
of this kind is demoralizing. I wonder whether America is
better off for exhorting foreigners to become citizens from
such motives, or whether it would not be more desirable to
instruct immigrants carefully on the altruistic side as to the
duty of sharing the responsibilities of American life.</p>

<p>It may be worth mentioning that thirty years of residence
in the city of Rome is required of any man, even of Italian
birth, in order to become a Roman citizen.</p>

<p>Human nature, fortunately, is always longing for an appeal
to its best side. I accompanied a friend when the American<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
citizenship was granted to him. The judge, a man with a
fine, clean-cut face, turned toward the candidates&mdash;there
were about a hundred in the room&mdash;and told the story of the
Pilgrim Fathers who, although starved and in great distress,
refused the opportunity of going back to England, where religious
and political freedom was denied them. The words
were to me an inspiration, and in glancing around I saw the
faces of those present light up and show signs of emotion.
Big Irishmen, heavy-faced Slavs, small, dried-up Jews, dark
Italians, small-headed Greeks, I could see in the eyes of them
all the light of men who were seeing a vision. The appeal to
the best there is in man should be the leading thought in educating
immigrants to a desire for American citizenship.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OTTO HERMANN KAHN</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Otto H. Kahn was born at Mannheim, Germany, February 21,
1867. His father had emigrated to the United States in 1848, where
he became a naturalized citizen, returning to Germany ten years
later. The son was educated in Germany and served one year in
the German army. He then learned banking, and for five years was
with the London branch of the Deutsche Bank. In 1893 he came to
the United States, where he became connected with the banking
house of Speyer &amp; Co., and later with the firm of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.</p>

<p>During the Great War Mr. Kahn delivered several patriotic
speeches which were collected under the title, “Right Above Race.”</p>

<p>The following excerpt is part of an address given at Carnegie
Institute, Pittsburgh, April 24, 1919.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_144" class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>


<h3>CAPITAL AND LABOR&mdash;A FAIR DEAL</h3>

<p>We have often heard it said recently&mdash;it has become rather
the fashion to say it&mdash;that the rulership of the world will
henceforth belong to labor. I yield to no one in my respect
and sympathy for labor, or in my cordial and sincere support
of its just claims. The structure of our institutions cannot
stand unless the masses of workmen, farmers, indeed all large
strata of society, feel that under and by these institutions
they are being given a square deal within the limits, not of
Utopia, but of what is sane, right and practicable.</p>

<p>But the rulership of the world will and ought to belong
to no one class. It will and ought to belong neither to labor
nor to capital, nor to any other class. It will, of right and
in fact, belong to those of all classes who acquire title to it
by talent, hard work, self-discipline, character and service.</p>

<p>He is no genuine friend or sound counselor of the people
nor a true patriot who recklessly, calculatingly or ignorantly
raises or encourages expectations which cannot or which ought
not to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>We must deal with all these things with common sense,
mutual trust, with respect for all, and with the aim of guiding
our conduct by the standard of liberty, justice and human
sympathy. But we must rightly understand liberty. We
must resolutely oppose those who in their impatient grasping
for unattainable perfection would make of liberty a raging
and destructive torrent instead of a majestic and fertilizing
stream.</p>

<p>Liberty is not fool-proof. For its beneficent working it
demands self-restraint, a sane and clear recognition of the
reality of things, of the practicable and attainable, and a
realization of the fact that there are laws of nature and of
economies which are immutable and beyond our power to
change.</p>

<p>Nothing in history is more pathetic than the record of the
instances when one or the other of the peoples of the world<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
rejoicingly followed a new lead which it was promised and
fondly believed would bring it to freedom and happiness,
and then suddenly found itself, instead, on the old and only
too well-trodden lane which goes through suffering and turmoil
to disillusionment and reaction.</p>

<p>I suppose most of us when we were twenty knew of a
short cut to the millennium, and were impatient, resentful
and rather contemptuous of those whose fossilized prejudices
or selfishness, as we regarded them, prevented that short cut
from becoming the high road of humanity.</p>

<p>Now that we are older, though we know that our eyes
will not behold the millennium, we should still like the
nearest possible approach to it; but we have learned that no
short cut leads there, and that anybody who claims to have
found one is either an impostor or self-deceived.</p>

<p>Among those wandering signposts to Utopia we find and
recognize certain recurrent types:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are those who, in the fervor of their world-improving
mission, discover and proclaim certain cure-alls for the
ills of humanity, which they fondly and honestly believe to
be new and unfailing remedies, but which, as a matter of
fact, are hoary with age, having been tried on this old globe
of ours at one time or another, in one of its parts or another,
long ago,&mdash;tried and found wanting and discarded after sad
disillusionment.</p>

<p>There are the spokesmen of sophomorism rampant, strutting
about in the cloak of superior knowledge, mischievously
and noisily, to the disturbance of quiet and orderly mental
processes and sane progress.</p>

<p>There are the sentimental, unseasoned, intolerant and
cocksure “advanced thinkers,” claiming leave to set the world
by the ears, and with their strident and ceaseless voices to
drown the views of those who are too busy to indulge in
much talking.</p>

<p>There are the self-seeking demagogues and various related
types, and finally there are the preachers and devotees of
liberty run amuck, who in fanatical obsession would place a
visionary and narrow class interest and a sloppy internationalism<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
above patriotism, and with whom class hatred and envy
have become a ruling passion. They are perniciously, ceaselessly
and vociferously active, though constituting but a small
minority of the people, and though every election and other
test has proved, fortunately, that they are not representative
of labor, either organized or unorganized.</p>

<p>Among these agitators and disturbers who dare clamorously
to assail the majestic and beneficent structure of American
traditions, doctrines and institutions there are some, far
too many, indeed&mdash;I say it with deep regret, being myself of
foreign birth&mdash;who are of foreign parentage or descent. With
many hundreds of thousands they or their parents came to
our free shores from lands of oppression and persecution.
The great republic generously gave them asylum and opened
wide to them the portals of her freedom and her opportunities.</p>

<p>The great bulk of these newcomers have become loyal and
enthusiastic Americans. Most of them have proved themselves
useful and valuable elements in our many-rooted population.
Some of them have accomplished eminent achievements
in science, industry and the arts. Certain of the qualities
and talents which they contribute to the common stock
are of great worth and promise.</p>

<p>When the great test of the war came, the overwhelming
majority of them rang wholly and finely true. The casualty
lists are eloquent testimony to the patriotic devotion of “the
children of the crucible,” doubly eloquent because many of
them fought against their own kith and kin.</p>

<p>But some there are who have been blinded by the glare of
liberty as a man is blinded who, after long confinement in
darkness, comes suddenly into the strong sunlight. Blinded,
they dare to aspire to force their guidance upon Americans
who for generations have walked in the light of liberty.</p>

<p>They have become drunk with the strong wine of freedom,
these men who until they landed on America’s coasts had
tasted little but the bitter water of tyranny. Drunk, they
presume to impose their reeling gait upon Americans to whom<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
freedom has been a pure and refreshing fountain for a century
and a half.</p>

<p>Brooding in the gloom of age-long oppression, they have
evolved a fantastic and distorted image of free government.
In fatuous effrontery they seek to graft the growth of their
stunted vision upon the splendid and ancient tree of American
institutions.</p>

<p>Admitted in generous trust to the hospitality of America,
they grossly violate not only the dictates of common gratitude,
but of those elementary rules of respect and consideration
which immemorial custom imposes upon the newcomer or
guest. They seek, indeed, to uproot the foundations of the
very house which gave them shelter.</p>

<p>We will not have it so, we who are Americans by birth or
by adoption. We reject these impudent pretentions. By all
means, let us move forward and upward, but let us proceed
by the chart of reason, experience and tested American principles
and doctrines, and let us not entrust our ship to demagogues,
visionaries or shallow sentimentalists who most assuredly
would steer it on the rocks.</p>

<p>When you once leave the level road of Americanism to
set foot upon the incline of Socialism, it is no longer in your
power to determine where you will stop. It is an axiom only
too well attested by the experience of the past, that the principal
elements of the established order of civilization (of
which the institution of private property is one) are closely
interrelated. If you tolerate grave infringement upon any of
these elements, all history shows that you will have laid open
to assault the foundations of personal liberty, of orderly processes
of government, of justice and tolerance, as well as the
institution of marriage, the sanctity of the home, and the
principles and practices of religion.</p>

<p>The strident voices of the fomenters of unrest do not cause
me any serious apprehension, but we must not sit silently by,
we must not look on inactively. Where there are grievances
to redress, where there are wrongs existing, we must all
aid in trying to right them to the best of our conscience and
ability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>To the extent that social and economic institutions, however
deep and ancient their roots, may be found to stand in
the way of the highest achievable level of social justice and
the widest attainable extension of opportunity, welfare and
contentment, they will have to submit to change. And the
less obstructive and stubborn, the more broad-minded, co-operative,
sympathetic and disinterested those who pre-eminently
prospered under the old conditions will prove themselves in
meeting the spirit of the new day and the reforms which it
may justly call for, the better it will be both for them and
for the community at large.</p>

<p>But to the false teaching and the various pernicious
“isms” with which un-Americans, fifty per cent. Americans
or anti-Americans are flooding the country, we must give
battle through an organized, persistent, patient, nationwide
campaign of education, of information, of sane and sound
doctrine. The masses of the American people want what is
right and fair, but they “want to be shown.” They will
not simply take our word for it that because a thing is so and
has always been so, therefore it should remain so. They do
not mean to stand still. They want progress. They have no
use for the standpatter and reactionary.</p>

<p>Even before the war a great stirring and ferment was going
on in the land. The people were groping, seeking for a
new and better condition of things. The war has intensified
that movement. It has torn great fissures in the ancient
structure of our civilization. To restore it will require the
co-operation of all patriotic men of sane and temperate views,
whatever may be their occupation or calling or political affiliations.</p>

<p>It cannot be restored just as it was before. The building
must be rendered more habitable and attractive to those whose
claim for adequate houseroom cannot be left unheeded, either
justly or safely. Some changes, essential changes, must be
made. I have no fear of the outcome and of the readjustment
which must come. I have no fear of the forces of freedom
unless they be ignored, repressed or falsely or selfishly led.</p>

<p>Changes the American people will make as their needs become<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
apparent, improvements they welcome, the greatest attainable
well-being for all those under our national roof-tree is
their aim. They will strive to realize what formerly were
considered unattainable ideals. But they will do all that in
the American way of sane and orderly progress&mdash;and in no
other.</p>

<p>Whatever betide in European countries, this nation will
not be torn from its ancient moorings. Against foes within,
no less than against enemies without, the American people
will ever know how to preserve and protect the splendid
structure of light and order, which is the treasured inheritance
of all those who rightfully bear the name Americans,
whatever their race and origin.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MARCUS ELI RAVAGE</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The story of the Rumanian immigrant, Marcus E. Ravage, was
published in 1917 under the title, “An American in the Making.”
The most significant steps in his transformation from alien to
American seem to have been his experiences as a sweat-shop worker
and as a student at the University of Missouri. It has sometimes
been thought that the immigrant who wishes to find the real America
should go West. At any rate Ravage is not the only one who has
felt the stimulus of the free and democratic spirit among the people
of the Great Plains. We have heard much in times past of an
exchange of professors between the United States and Europe. One
wonders whether a more liberal exchange both of professors and
students between our larger and smaller, our Eastern and Western
and Northern and Southern, and our metropolitan and our rural institutions
of higher learning might not be beneficial to the intellectual
life of the colleges and universities and also, by helping to eradicate
provincialism and sectionalism, to greater and more abiding national
unity.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_151" class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>


<h3>THE NEW IMMIGRATION</h3>

<p>Oh, if I could show you America as we of the oppressed
peoples see it! If I could bring home to you even the smallest
fraction of this sacrifice and this upheaval, the dreaming and
the strife, the agony and the heartache, the endless disappointments,
the yearning and the despair,&mdash;all of which must
be ours before we can make a home for our battered spirits
in this land of yours. Perhaps if we be young we dream of
riches and adventure, and if we be grown men we may merely
seek a haven for our outraged human souls and a safe retreat
for our hungry wives and children. Yet however aggrieved
we may feel toward our native home, we cannot but regard
our leaving it as a violent severing of the ties of our life, and
look beyond toward our new home as a sort of glorified exile.
So, whether we be young or old, something of ourselves we
always leave behind in our hapless, cherished birthplaces.
And the heaviest share of our burden inevitably falls on the
loved ones that remain when we are gone. We make no
illusions for ourselves. Though we may expect wealth, we
have no thought of returning. It is farewell forever. We
are not setting out on a trip; we are emigrating. Yes, we are
emigrating, and there is our experience, our ordeal, in a nutshell.
It is the one-way passport for us every time. For
we have glimpsed a vision of America, and we start out resolved
that, whatever the cost, we shall make her our own.
In our heavy-laden hearts we are already Americans. In our
own dumb way we have grasped her message to us.</p>

<p>Yes, we immigrants have a real claim on America. Every
one of us who did not grow faint-hearted at the start of the
battle, and has stuck it out, has earned a share in America
by the ancient right of conquest. We have had to subdue
this new home of ours to make it habitable, and in conquering
it we have conquered ourselves. We are not what we
were when you saw us landing from the Ellis Island ferry.
Our own kinsfolk do not know us when they come over. We
sometimes hardly know ourselves.</p>

<p><span id="Page_152" class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>


<h3 class="nobreak">WHAT COLLEGE LIFE IN THE WEST DID
FOR AN IMMIGRANT</h3>


<h4>ACQUIRING A SENSE OF HUMOR</h4>

<p>On the whole, then, it looked as if I might yet work out
my salvation if only those barbarians would leave me to myself.
But it was not in them to do that. They seemed determined
on disturbing my peace of mind. They were devoting,
I honestly believe, all their spare thoughts and all their inventive
genius to thinking up ways of making me uncomfortable.
One young gentleman, still reminiscent of my
ignorance of rural things, made up a tale of how I went to
get a job on a farm, and proceeded to relate it at the table.
“The farmer gave Max a pail and a stool and sent him
out to milk the cow. About an hour later, when the old boy
failed to show up with the stuff, Reuben went out to see what
was the trouble. He found his new assistant in a fierce pickle.
His clothes were torn and his hands and face were bleeding
horribly. ‘What in heck is the matter?’ asked the farmer.
‘Oh, curse the old cow!’ said Max, ‘I can’t make her sit on
that stool.’” A burst of merriment greeted the climactic
ending, although the yarn was a trifle musty; and the most
painful part of it was that I must laugh at the silly thing myself.</p>

<p>It was not at all true, as one of my numerous room-mates
tried to intimate, that I shunned baths. I was merely conservative
in the matter. One day, however, he had the indelicacy
to ask me the somewhat personal question whether I
ever took a bath; and I told him rather sullenly, that I did
once in a while. Some time later I overheard him repeat the
dialogue to the other men in the house and provoking shouts
of laughter. It puzzled me to see where the joke was, until
I learned that these fellows were taking a shower-bath at the
gymnasium every day. It seemed to me that that was running
a good thing into the ground. Again, I noticed that my<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
room-mates were making a great show of their toothbrushes.
They used them after every meal and before retiring&mdash;as
the advertisements say&mdash;and always with an unnecessary
amount of splash and clatter. At home I had been
taught to keep my mouth and teeth clean without all this
fuss. Nevertheless, I thought that I would get a brush and
join in the drill. After that the other brushes became noticeably
quiet.</p>

<p>And then, of course, there was the institution of the practical
joke. On April 1st there was soap in the pie. If you
got in late to a meal, it was wise to brush your chair and
“pick your bites,” if any bites were left. If not, there was no
telling what you might swallow or sit on. More than once
I tasted salt in my water and pepper in my biscuits. I seemed
to have been marked from the first as a fit subject for these
pranks.</p>

<p>On Hallowe’en a squad of cadets commanded by a corporal
entered my room and ordered me to get into my uniform,
shoulder my gun, and proceed to the gymnasium, which, according
to the order read, the commandant assigned me to
guard against stragglers. I guarded through a whole uneventful
night. Toward morning the captain of the football
team, who had a room in the gymnasium, returned from a
party. I ordered him to halt and give the password. He
smiled and tried to enter. I made a lunge for him, and
would have run my bayonet through him if he had not begun
to laugh. “Go on home, you poor boy,” he said. “They
pull that stunt off every year. Poor joke, I think.” The
next day my table-mates tried to jolly me about it. They
said I would be court-martialed as a deserter from duty. I
got angry, and that made them all the more hilarious. Then
a great, strapping fellow named Harvey spoke up. “Be still,
you galoots,” he said to them; and then to me, “For gosh
sake, fellow, be human!” I tried a long time to figure out
what he meant by “human,” and for the rest of my college
career I strove to follow his advice. It was the first real
hint I had got on what America, through her representatives<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
in Missouri, was expecting of me. Harvey became my
first American friend.</p>


<h4>THE ROMANCE OF READJUSTMENT</h4>

<p>So to New York I went, and lived through the last and
the bitterest episode in the romance of readjustment. During
that whole strenuous year, while I was fighting my battle
for America, I had never for a moment stopped to figure the
price it was costing me. I had not dreamed that my mere
going to Missouri had opened up a gulf between me and the
world I had come from, and that every step I was taking
toward my ultimate goal was a stride away from everything
that had once been mine, that had once been myself. Now,
no sooner had I alighted from the train than it came upon
me with a pang that that one year out there had loosened
ties that I had imagined were eternal.</p>

<p>There was Paul faithfully at the ferry, and as I came off
he rushed up to me and threw his arms around me and kissed
me affectionately. Did I kiss him back? I am afraid not.
He took the grip out of my hand and carried it to the Brooklyn
Bridge. Then we boarded a car. I asked him where we
were going, and he said, mysteriously, “To Harry’s.” A
surprise was awaiting me, apparently. As we entered the
little alley of a store in the Italian quarter, I looked about
me and saw no one. But suddenly there was a burst of
laughter from a dozen voices, a door or two opened violently,
and my whole family was upon me,&mdash;brothers, a new sister-in-law,
cousins of various degrees, some old people, a few
children. They rushed me into the apartment behind the
store, pelting me with endearments and with questions. The
table was set as for a Purim feast. There was an odor of
pot-roasted chicken, and my eye caught a glimpse of chopped
eggplant. As the meal progressed, my heart was touched by
their loving thoughtfulness. Nothing had been omitted,&mdash;not
even the red wine and the Turkish peas and rice. Harry
and every one else kept on urging me to eat. “It’s a long time
since you have had a real meal,” said my sister-in-law. How<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
true it was! But I felt constrained, and ate very little. Here
were the people and the things I had so longed to be with;
but I caught myself regarding them with the eyes of a Western
American. Suddenly&mdash;at one glance, as it were&mdash;I
grasped the answer to the problem that had puzzled me so
long; for here in the persons of those dear to me I was seeing
myself as those others had seen me.</p>

<p>I went about revisiting old scenes, and found that everything
had changed in my brief absence. My friends were
not the same; the East Side was not the same. They never
would be the same. What had come over them? My kinsfolk
and my old companions looked me over and declared that
it was I who had become transformed. I had become soberer.
I carried myself differently. There was an unfamiliar reserve,
something mingled of coldness and melancholy, in my eye. My
very speech had a new intonation. It was more incisive, but,
less fluent, less cordial, they thought. Perhaps so. At any
rate, while my people were still dear to me, and always
would be dear to me, the atmosphere about them repelled me.
If it <em>was</em> I who had changed, then, as I took in the little
world I had emerged from, I could not help telling myself
that the change was a salutary one.</p>

<p>While calling at the old basement bookshop on East Broadway
I suddenly heard a horrible wailing and lamenting on
the street. A funeral procession was hurrying by, followed
by several women in an open carriage. Their hair was flying,
their faces were red with weeping, their bodies were swaying
grotesquely to the rhythm of their violent cries. The oldest
in the group continued mechanically to address the body in
the hearse: “Husband dear, upon whom have you left us?
Upon whom, husband dear?” A young girl facing her in
the vehicle looked about in a terrified manner, seized every
now and then the hand of her afflicted mother, and tried to
quiet her. The frightful scene, with its tragic display, its
abysmal ludicrousness, its barbarous noise, revolted me. I
had seen the like of it before, but that was in another life.
I had once been part of such a performance myself, and the
grief of it still lingered somewhere in my motley soul. But<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
now I could only think of the affecting simplicity, the quiet,
unobtrusive solemnity of a burial I had witnessed the previous
spring in the West.</p>

<p>The afternoon following my arrival I flew uptown to see
Esther. She waved to me and smiled as I approached&mdash;she
had been waiting on the “stoop.” As she shook my hand in
her somewhat masculine fashion, she took me in with a glance,
and the first thing she said was: “What a genteel person
you have become! You have changed astonishingly.” “Do
you think so?” I asked her. “I am afraid I haven’t. At least
they do not think so in Missouri.” Then she told me that she
had got only ten points, but that she was expecting three more
in the fall. She was almost resigned to wait another year before
entering college. That would enable her to make her total
requirements, save up a little more money, and get her
breath. “A woman is not a man, you know,” she added.
“I am beginning to feel the effects of it all. I am really
exhausted. Geometry has nearly finished me. And mother
has added her share. She is no longer young, and this
winter she was ill. I have worried and I have had to send
money. But let us not talk about my troubles. You are
full of things to tell me, I know.”</p>

<p>Yes, I had lots I wanted to say, but I did not know where
to begin; and the one thing that was uppermost in my mind I
was afraid to utter lest she should misunderstand and feel injured
and reproach me. I did not want her to reproach me
on first meeting. I wanted to give myself time as well as
her. And so we fell into one of those customary long silences,
and for a while I felt at home again, and reflected that perhaps
I had been hasty in letting the first poignant reactions
mislead me. Toward evening Esther remarked that it was
fortunate I had got to town the day before. If I had no
other plans, she would take me to a meeting at Clinton Hall
where Michailoff was to speak on “The Coming Storm in
America.” It would be exciting, she said, and enlightening.
Michailoff had just come out of prison. He was full of new
impressions of America and “the system” generally, and one
could rely on him to tear things open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>Of course we went, and the assemblage was noisy and
quarrelsome and intolerant, and the hall was stuffy and
smelly, and the speaker was honest and fiery and ill-informed.
He thundered passionately, and as if he were detailing a personal
grievance against American individualism and the benighted
Americans who allowed a medieval religion and an
oppressive capitalistic system to mulct and exploit them, and
referred to a recent article in the <cite>Zukunft</cite> where the writer
had weakly admitted the need of being fair even to Christianity,
and insisted that to be fair to an enemy of humanity
was to be a traitor to humanity. I listened to it all with an
alien ear. Soon I caught myself defending the enemy out
there. What did these folk know of Americans, anyhow?
Michailoff was, after all, to radicalism what Higgins and
Moore were to Christianity. His idea of being liberal was to
tolerate anarchism if you were a socialist and communism if
you were an individualist. And, as we left the hall, I told
Esther what I had hesitated to tell her earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>“Save yourself, my dear friend. Run as fast as you can.
You will find a bigger and freer world than this. Promise
me that you will follow me to the West this fall. You will
thank me for it. Those big, genuine people out in Missouri
are the salt of the earth. Whatever they may think about the
problem of universal brotherhood, they have already solved it
for their next-door neighbors. There is no need of the social
revolution in Missouri; they have a generous slice of the
kingdom of heaven.”</p>

<p>Maybe I was exaggerating, but that was how I felt. From
this distance and from these surroundings Missouri and the
new world she meant to me was enchanting and heroic. The
loneliness I had endured, the snubbing, the ridicule, the inner
struggles&mdash;all the dreariness and the sadness of my life in exile&mdash;had
faded out of the picture, and what remained was
only an idealized vision of the clean manhood, the large
human dignity, the wholesome, bracing atmosphere of it,
which contrasted so strikingly with the things around me.</p>

<p>No, there was no sense in deceiving myself, the East Side
had somehow ceased to be my world. I had thought a few<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
days ago that I was going home. I had yelled to Harvey
from the train, as it was pulling out of the station at Columbia,
“I am going home, old man!” But I had merely come
to another strange land. In the fall I would return to that
other exile. I was, indeed, a man without a country.</p>

<p>During that entire summer, while I opened gates on an
Elevated train in Brooklyn, I tussled with my problem. It
was quite apparent to me from the first what its solution
must be. I knew that now there was no going back for me;
that my only hope lay in continuing in the direction I had
taken, however painful it may be to my loved ones and to
myself. But for a long time I could not admit it to myself.
A host of voices and sights and memories had awakened
within me that clutched me to my people and to my past.</p>

<p>As long as I remained in New York I kept up the tragic
farce of making Sunday calls on brother Harry and pretending
that all was as before, that America and education had
changed nothing, that I was still one of them. I had taken a
room in a remote quarter of Brooklyn, where there were few
immigrants, under the pretense that it was nearer to the
railway barns. But I was deceiving no one but myself.
Most of my relatives, who had received me so heartily when
I arrived, seemed to be avoiding Harry’s house on Sundays,
and on those rare occasions when I ran into one of them he
seemed frigid and ill at ease. Once Paul said to me: “You
are very funny. It looks as if you were ashamed of the family.
You aren’t really, are you? You know they said you
would be when you went away. There is a lot of foolish talk
about it. Everybody speaks of Harry and me as the doctor’s
brothers. Can’t you warm up?”</p>

<p>I poured out my heart in a letter to Harvey. If a year
ago I had been told that I would be laying my sorrows and
my disappointments in my own kindred before any one out
there, I would have laughed at the idea. But that barbarian
in Missouri was the only human being, strangely enough, in
whom I could now confide with any hope of being understood.
I tried to convey to him some idea of the agonizing
moral experience I was going through. I told him that I<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
was aching to get back to Columbia (how apt the name
was!), to take up again where I had left off the process of
my transformation, and to get through with it as soon as
might be.</p>

<p>And in the fall I went back&mdash;this time a week <em>before</em> college
opened&mdash;and was met by Harvey at the station, just as
those rural-looking boys had been met by their friends the
year before. When I reached the campus, I was surprised
to see how many people knew me. Scores of them came up
and slapped me on the back and shook hands in their hearty,
boisterous fashion, and hoped that I had had a jolly summer.
I was asked to join boarding-clubs, to become a member in
debating societies, to come and see this fellow or that in his
room. It took me off my feet, this sudden geniality of my
fellows toward me. I had not been aware how, throughout
the previous year, the barriers between us had been gradually
and steadily breaking down. It came upon me all at once. I
felt my heart going out to my new friends. I had become
one of them. I was not a man without a country. I was
an American.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ELIZABETH G. STERN</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The pathos of the readjustment of the foreign-born to the new life
in America has nowhere been more touchingly presented than in the
story, “My Mother and I,” by Mrs. E. G. Stern, who was born in
Russian Poland.</p>

<p>Anyone who has gone on a long journey to make his home far
from friends and relatives knows something of the pain of separating
from loved ones; but the pain of such a separation cannot compare
with the travail of taking a far spiritual journey. That one may
still have deep reverence for the past, though breaking away from
it, is the conviction of the author, who says: “And I shall always
remember that, though my life is now part of my land’s, yet, if I am
truly part of America, it was mother, she who does not understand
America, who made me so. I wonder if, as the American mother I
strive to be, I can find a finer example than my own mother!”</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_161" class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>


<h3>THE PATHOS OF READJUSTMENT</h3>


<h4>AUTHOR’S PURPOSE IN WRITING</h4>

<p>The mere writing of this account is a chain, slight, but
never to be broken; one that will always bind me to that
from which I had thought myself forever cut off. For I am
writing not only of myself. In myself I see one hundred
thousand young men and women with dark eyes aflame with
enthusiasm, or blue eyes alight with hope. In myself, as I
write this record, I see the young girl whose father plucked
oranges in Italian gardens, the maiden whose mother worked
on still mornings in the wide fields of Poland, the young
man whose grandmother toiled in the peat bogs of Ireland.
I am writing this for myself and for those who, like me, are
America’s foster children, to remind us of them, through
whose pioneer courage the bright gates of this beautiful land
of freedom were opened to us, and upon whose tumuli of
gray and weary years of struggle we, their children, rose to
our opportunities. I am writing to those sons and daughters
of immigrant fathers and mothers who are now in America,
and to those who will come after this devastating war to
America, and to those who will receive them.</p>


<h4>MARRIAGE AND AFTER</h4>

<p>My friends are now my husband’s friends. My home is
that kind of a home in which he has always lived. With my
marriage I entered into a new avenue. We have traveled.
We have worked at tasks we believed in and loved. We have
our little son. I have not written much to mother about my
life. My letters have been&mdash;just letters. Her own letters
have been growing briefer these last years. She never came
to see me in my home.</p>

<p>It was our little son who was the real cause of her coming
finally. I thought of his birth as the tearing down of
that barrier that had come between us. Mother was intoxicated<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
with the delight of her first grandchild, the first child
of her first child. “Now we understand each other better,
now that we both are mothers, my daughter,” she wrote to
me, not knowing how much more than she meant to say her
letters told. I, too, felt that in my own motherhood I saw
the explanation now for mother’s unquestioning, unceasing
striving and toiling and hoping and planning and achieving
for her children. “Now I can find the joy of all mothers
again. I can find my lost young motherhood in your child,”
she wrote. “I am coming to my grandson.”</p>

<p>Mother had not traveled since she took that long trip,
twenty-five years ago, from Poland to America, to come to
her husband. And now she was preparing to come from
Soho&mdash;to us, to her first grandchild. We were excited as
the letters from home told us that they were. Day after
day, my sisters wrote to us, women came to mother, giving
her messages to take to me, whom they had known so well
as a child. They brought mother cake and jellies and wines,
as if she were about to travel a year instead of one night. My
aunts came to help her sew her clothes, my uncles came to
pack her suitcases. It was as if all Soho were coming here
to us in the person of mother. Father hurried back and forth
securing mileages, a berth. He carefully explained to mother
what a berth was, and warned her above all not to forget to
give the black man, when he gave her her hat, a quarter. My
sisters wrote such dear letters, describing it all there at home.</p>

<p>We could hardly wait. Our little boy asked every day for
“grammy.” There came a deluge of telegrams to us, which
clearly told us the haste and nervousness in the little home in
Soho, and we knew that mother was on her way to us.</p>

<p>She came in the morning. She did not stop to kiss me,
nor to look about her, but as soon as she entered my home
she cried breathlessly, “Where is my grandchild?” And she
held him to her, and the tears filled her eyes. “Such a boy!
But a boy!” she cried. We had written to her that our boy
was speaking now. She sat down beside him, and she crooned
love-words to him.</p>

<p>Son is a friendly little lad. I felt that, if I left them alone<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
together, he and mother would grow close in a day or two.
I peeped one morning into the nursery. Mother was standing,
looking dully at the spotless baby cot, the white wicker
chairs, the little washable rugs on the floor, the gay pictures
on the white walls. Her worn plump hands were folded one
upon the other in a gesture that I know. Little son was in a
corner, gravely building a tower. Little son has been taught
that he must play without demanding help or attention from
adults about him, that “son must help himself.” In Soho
little boys are spanked and scolded and carried and physicked
and loved and fed all day and all night.</p>

<p>Mother called to little son a quaint love name, and he
turned to her with his bright smile, understanding her love
tone. Then he quietly turned away from her to his toys
again. And mother stood there in that strange white baby
world which was her grandson’s. Perhaps she was thinking
of what she had thought to find him, like one of the children
of her own young motherhood, dear burdens that one
bore night and day. She was afraid to touch the crib, to soil
the spotless rugs. Here was her grandchild, they were together,
it is true. And her grandchild had no need of her.
She felt alien, unnecessary.</p>

<p>I felt the tears in my eyes. I ran in, called son to come to
play with grammy and mother. He came readily, laughingly,
speaking his baby phrases that are so adorably like the
words we adults, his parents, use. I had been anticipating,
even before she came, how much mother and I would enjoy
his baby talk. But mother said in a very low voice, “You
say he speaks, daughter. I do not understand the words he
means to say now. And&mdash;he will never learn&mdash;learn my language.”</p>

<p>And mother’s first tears fell.</p>

<p>We had planned for every hour of her visit to us, even
for the hours of needed rest between whiles. In those rest
spaces she would come into our living room. She is not
accustomed to sitting in living rooms. Her life has been a
life of toil. And our living room is to her as strange a place
as was to me the first sitting room I saw long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[164]</span></p>

<p>She looked with a little smile about her. She glanced at
the bookcase, filled with books she cannot read, and about
things she does not know. Finally her gaze rested upon a
certain place, and my eyes followed hers. There stood the
old candlesticks which she had known in her father’s home
in Poland, and which had stood in her own kitchen in Soho.
And there, in my living room stands also, with its bronze
curves holding autumn leaves&mdash;the copper fish pot! “In
America,” said mother quaintly, with a little “crooked smile”
only on her trembling, questioning lips, “they have all things&mdash;so
different.”</p>

<p>There is no need for mother’s pot in my kitchen; it has
become an emblem of the past, an ornament in my living
room. Mother cannot understand our manner of cooking,
the manner I learned <em>away</em> from home. She cannot eat the
foods we have; her plate at meals was left almost untouched.
She does not understand my white kitchen, used only for
cooking. When she came into my kitchen, my maid asked
her quickly, eager to please her, pleasantly and respectfully,
“What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>So mother went out to the porch, and she looked out upon
the tree-shaded street. And an infinite loneliness was hers, a
loneliness at thought of the crowded, homely ghetto street,
where every one goes about in shirt sleeves, or apron and
kimono, where every one knows his neighbor, where every
one speaks mother’s speech.</p>

<p>She cannot understand my friends, nor they her. I am
the only thing here that is part of her life. I for whom those
hands of hers are hard and worn, and her eyes weary with the
stitching of thousands of seams. She helped me to come into
this house, to reach the quiet peace of this street. And she
has come to see this place whither she toiled to have me
come; and now that she came to see my goal she was afraid,
lonely. She did not understand.</p>

<p>There is nothing that we have in common, it may appear,
this mother of mine, and I, the mother of my son. Her life
has lain always within the four dim walls of her ghetto home.
And I have books, clubs, social service, music, plays. My<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
motherhood is a privilege and an experience which is meaningful
not only to my son and to me, but to my community.
In this short visit of hers, for the first time mother saw me as
that which I had always wished to be, an American woman
at the head of an American home. But our home is a home
which, try as I may, we cannot make home to mother. She
has seen come to realization those things which she helped me
to attain, and she cannot share, nor even understand, them.</p>

<p>But there is one thing we have in common, mother and I.
We have this woman that I am, this woman mother has
helped me to become. And I shall always remember that,
though my life is now part of my land’s, yet, if I am truly
part of America, it was mother, she who does not understand
America, who made me so. I wonder if, as the American
mother I strive to be, I can find a finer example than my
own mother!</p>

<p>There are many men and women who have gone, as I
have, far from that place where we started. When I think
of them lecturing on the platform, teaching in schools and
colleges, prescribing in offices, pleading before the bar of law,
I shall never be able to see them standing alone. I shall
always see, behind them, two shadowy figures who will stand
with questioning, puzzled eyes, eyes in which there will be
love, but no understanding, and always an infinite loneliness.</p>

<p>For those men and women who are physicians and lawyers
and teachers and writers, they are young, and they belong to
America. And they who recede into the shadow, they are
old, and they do not understand America. But they have
made their contribution to America&mdash;their sons and their
daughters.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ROBERT M. WERNAER</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Robert Maximilian Wernaer was born in 1865 in Jena, Germany,
where he received his early education. After coming to the United
States in 1884, he took a course in law at the Albany Law School,
and attended Harvard University, from which he received his Ph.D.
degree in 1903. His studies were continued abroad at Leipzig,
Heidelberg, Geneva, and Berlin. He was admitted to the Bar in
1889 and practiced law in Brooklyn and New York. Later he was
instructor in German at the universities of Wisconsin and Harvard,
being also lecturer on German literature at the latter institution in
1908.</p>

<p>In 1917 there was published his stirring, patriotic poem, “The
Soul of America,” which leaves no doubt concerning his stand on
the great question of the hour. The parts reprinted here are taken
chiefly from the opening cantos of the poem.</p></div>

<h2 class="nobreak">ANGELO PATRI</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The country which gave Dante and Garibaldi and Mazzini and
Madame Montessori to the world saw the birth, in 1877, of Angelo
Patri, teacher in the public schools of New York City and author
of “A Schoolmaster of the Great City.” This book recounts his
endeavors to realize his educational ideals. That he has been triumphantly
successful does not seem to be entirely to the credit of contemporary
pedagogical methods, and his arraignment of much
current educational theory and practice is as severe as his passionate,
Christ-like love of childhood is touching and beautiful. The World
War has convinced educators rather generally of the need of vitalizing
the work of the schools through contact with life itself, and for
this none pleads more eloquently than he.</p>

<p>The following selections under altered titles are taken from chapters
one, seven and eight.</p></div>

<p><span id="Page_174" class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>


<h3>AN IMMIGRANT AND HIS FATHER</h3>

<p>I remember sitting with the family and the neighbors’
families about the fireplace, while father, night after night,
told us stories of the Knights of the Crusades or recounted
the glories of the heroes of proud Italy.</p>

<p>How he could tell a story! His voice was strong and soft
and soothing, and he had just sufficient power of exaggeration
to increase the attractiveness of the tale. We could see
the soldiers he told us about pass before us in all their struggles
and sorrows and triumphs. Back and forth he marched
them into Asia Minor, across Sicily, and into the castles of
France, Germany and England. We listened eagerly and
came back each night ready to be thrilled and inspired again
by the spirit of the good and the great.</p>

<p>Then came the journey over the sea, and the family with
the neighbors’ families were part of the life of New York.
We were Little Italy.</p>

<p>I was eleven before I went to a city school. All the English
I knew had been learned in the street. I knew Italian.
From the time I was seven I had written letters for the neighbors.
Especially the women folk took me off to a corner and
asked me to write letters to their friends in Italy. As they
told me the story, I wrote it down. I thus learned the beat
of plain folks’ hearts.</p>

<p>My uncle from whom I had learned Italian went back to
Italy, and I was left without a teacher; so one day I attached
myself to a playmate and went to school,&mdash;an “American”
school. I gave my name and my age, and was told to sit in
a long row of benches with some sixty other children. The
teacher stood at the blackboard and wrote “March 5, 1887.”
We all read it after her, chanting the singsong with the
teacher. Each morning we did the same thing; that is, repeated
lessons after the teacher. That first day and the second
day were alike, and so were the years that followed. “If
one yard of goods cost three cents, how much will twenty-five<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
yards cost?” If one yard costs three cents, then twenty-five
yards will cost twenty-five times three cents, or seventy-five
cents. The explanation could not vary, or it might not
be true or logical.</p>

<p>But there was one thing that was impressed more strongly
than this routine. I had always been a sickly, thin, pale-faced
child. I did not like to sit still. I wanted to play, to
talk, to move about. But if I did any of these things, I was
kept after school as a punishment. This would not do. I
had to get out of the room, and frequently I endured agonies
because the teacher would not permit me to leave the room
whenever I wanted to. Many times I went home sick and
lay abed.</p>

<p>Soon I discovered that the boys who sat quietly, looked
straight ahead and folded their arms behind their backs, and
even refused to talk to their neighbors, were allowed the
special privilege of leaving the room for one minute, not
longer. So I sat still, very still, for hours and hours, so that
I might have the one minute. Throughout my whole school
life this picture remains uppermost. I sat still, repeated
words, and then obtained my minute allowance.</p>

<p>For ten years I did this, and because I learned words I
was able to go from the first year of school through the
last year of college. My illness and the school discipline had
helped after all. They had made my school life shorter by
several years than it otherwise might have been.</p>

<p>The colony life of the city’s immigrants is an attempt to
continue the village traditions of the mother country. In our
neighborhood there were hundreds of families that had come
from the same part of Italy. On summer nights they gathered
in groups on the sidewalks, the stoops, the courtyards,
and talked and sang and dreamed. In winter the men and
boys built Roman arches out of the snow.</p>

<p>But gradually the families grew in size. The neighborhood
became congested. A few families moved away. Ours
was one of them. We began to be a part of the new mass
instead of the old. The city with its tremendous machinery,
its many demands, its constant calling, calling, began to take<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
hold. What had been intimate, quaint, beautiful, ceased to
appeal.</p>

<p>I went to school, father went to work, mother looked
after the house. When evening came, instead of sitting
about the fire, talking and reliving the day, we sat, each in
his own corner. One nursed his tired bones, another prepared
his lessons for the morrow. The demands of the
school devoured me; the work world exhausted my father.
The long evenings of close contact with my home people
were becoming rare. I was slipping away from my home;
home was slipping away from me.</p>

<p>Yet my father knew what he was about. While the
fathers of most of the boys about me were putting their
money into business or into their houses, mine put his
strength, his love, his money, his comforts into making me
better than himself. The spirit of the crusaders should live
again in his son. He wanted me to become a priest: I
wanted to become a doctor.</p>

<p>During all the years that he worked for me, I worked
for myself. While his hopes were centred in the family,
mine were extending beyond it. I worked late into the
nights, living a life of which my father was not a part. This
living by myself tended to make me forget, indeed to undervalue,
the worth of my people. I was ashamed sometimes
because my folk did not look or talk like Americans.</p>

<p>When most depressed by the feeling of living crudely and
poorly, I would go out to see my father at work. I would
see him high up on a scaffold a hundred feet in the air, and
my head would get dizzy and my heart would rise to my
throat. Then I would think of him once more as the poet
story-teller with the strong, soothing voice and the far-off
visioned eye, and would see why on two-dollar-a-day wages
he sent me to college.</p>

<p>Proud of his strength, I would strengthen my moral fibre
and respond to his dream. Yet not as he dreamed; for when
he fell fifty feet down a ladder and was ill for a whole year,
I went to work at teaching.</p>

<p><span id="Page_177" class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>


<h3>AN IMMIGRANT AND THE CHILDREN</h3>

<p>The schools will change for the better when their life is
made basically different from what it has been.</p>

<p>They are pointed in the direction of the fundamentals of
knowledge, but working with the tools of the classicists.
They have developed and developed until we find life on one
side,&mdash;that is, outside the school,&mdash;and learning on the other
side,&mdash;that is, inside the school. Now the schools must be
pointed so that life and the school become one.</p>

<p>To begin with, better school conditions must be provided
for the youngest children. The first steps in child teaching
must be sound. The primary years of school must be worth
while. Unless the basic structure is real, soul satisfying,
higher education will be halting and futile. The child is entitled
to a fine start in his life’s journey if he is to have a
fair chance of carrying his head high and his shoulders
straight.</p>

<p>He comes to school a distinct personality. He is joyous,
spontaneous, natural, free. But from the first day, instead
of watching, encouraging that personality, the school begins
to suppress it and keeps up the process year in and year out.
By and by we begin to search for the individuality that has
been submerged. We make tempting offers to the student
in the high school and in the college&mdash;we give him better
teachers, better equipment, greater freedom, more leisure,
smaller classes, direct experiences. We call upon him to
stand out, to face the problems of life honestly, squarely,&mdash;to
be himself. How blind we are! First we kill, and then
we weep for that which we have slain.</p>

<p>We do not look upon the children as an important economic
factor. Children are a problem to the parent and
teacher, but not to the race.</p>

<p>Do you raise pigs? The government is almost tearful in
its solicitude for their health and welfare. The Agricultural
Bureau sends you scientific data gathered at great pains and
expense. But do you raise children? Ah! They are very<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
expensive. And there are so many of them! One teacher to
fifty is the best we can do for you. Teachers who are specialists
in their profession? Oh, now really! You know we
could never afford that. We must pay for high-priced
teachers for the high schools and upper grades, but for the
little children&mdash;all you want is a pleasant personality that is
able to teach the rudiments of learning. There’s not much
to do in those grades&mdash;just the rudiments, you know. There’s
no disciplining to do there, the children are so easily suppressed.
It’s only in the upper grades we have the trouble!</p>

<p>Stupid and topsy-turvy!</p>

<p>We need the scientist, the child specialist, the artist, in
the first year of school. We need few children to a teacher
and plenty of space to move about in.</p>

<p>It’s there the teacher should eagerly, anxiously, reverently,
watch for the little spark of genius, of soul, of individuality,
and so breathe the breath of life upon it that it can never
again be crushed or repressed.</p>

<p>We must spend more money on elementary education if
the money we now spend on higher education is to bring
forth results that are commensurate with our national needs.
We spend fifty dollars a year on the education of a child and
ten times that amount on the education of a young college
man....</p>

<p>Do we really believe in children? Can we say with the
Roman mother, “These are my jewels”? How long ago is
it that the state legislature passed a bill enabling the canneries
to employ children and women twelve hours a day? Fifty
children to a teacher, adulterated foods, military discipline,
are not beliefs in children. Enslaving mothers is not a belief
in children.</p>

<p>Our belief in children, like our belief in many other good
things, is mainly a word belief. What we need is a practical
belief. We are still at the stage where we separate work and
thought, action and theory, practice and ethics. If we would
be saved, we must follow the child’s way of life. His way is
the direct way. He learns from contact with the forces
about him. He feels them, he sees them, he knows what they<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
do to him. He thinks and does and discovers all in one
continuous flow of energy.</p>

<p>The child says: “I am of things as they are. I am the
fighter for the things that ought to be. I was the beginning
of human progress, and I am the progress of the world. I
drive the world on. I invent, I achieve, I reform. About
me is always the glory of mounting. I have no fear of falling,
of slipping down, down. I have no fear of being lost.
I am truth. I am reality, and always I question chaos.”</p>

<p>When the child begins to question the wisdom of the
group, its religion, its literature, its dress, its tastes, its
method of government, its standard of judgment, that moment
the group should begin to take heed. It should take
the child’s questioning seriously. When the group fails to
do this, it gives up its existence, it ceases to grow because it
looks back, it worships tradition, it makes history in terms of
the past rather than in terms of the future.</p>

<p>Belief in evolution is a belief in the child.</p>

<p>What the race needs is a principle of growth, spiritual
growth, that can never be denied. Such a principle it will
find in the child, because the spirit of the child is the one factor
of the group existence that in itself keeps changing, growing.
The child is nature’s newest experiment in her search
for a better type, and the race will be strong as it determines
that the experiment shall be successful.</p>

<p>We develop national characteristics in accord with our adherence
to a common ideal. We must therefore surrender
ourselves for the common good, and the common good to
which we should surrender is epitomized in the child idea.</p>

<p>I feel that the attitude towards the school and the child is
the ultimate attitude by which America is to be judged. Indeed,
the distinctive contribution America is to make to the
world’s progress is not political, economical, religious, but
educational, the child our national strength, the school as the
medium through which the adult is to be remade.</p>

<p>What an ideal for the American people!</p>

<p>When my father came to America, he thought of America
only as a temporary home. He learned little or no English.<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
As the years went by he would say, “It is enough; my
children know English.” Then more years rolled by. One
day he came to me and asked me to help him get his citizenship
papers. He and I began reading history together. Month
after month we worked, laboring, translating, questioning,
until the very day of his examination.</p>

<p>That day I hurried home from college to find a smiling,
happy father. “Did you get them?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the judge wanted to know how I knew the answers
so well, and I told him my son who goes to college
taught me, and the judge complimented me.”</p>

<p>I have been a part of many movements to Americanize the
foreigner, but I see that the child is the only one who can
carry the message of democracy if the message is to be carried
at all. If the child fails to make the connection between the
ideals of the school and the fundamental beliefs of the people,
there is none other to do it. The children are the chain
that must bind people together.</p>

<p>I have told about parents growing because they sought
growth for their children. I saw them grow through the initiative
of the school. These were tenement dwellers. Would
this thing hold where the parents are well to do, and the
streets are clean and music is of the best, and home ideals
are of the highest and the social life of the neighborhood is
intimate? Is it still necessary for the school to gather the
parents about itself? Is it still necessary for the school to
go out into the community and get the parents to consciously
work as a group for the children’s interest, to consciously
shape their philosophy of life in conformity with the dynamic
philosophy that childhood represents?</p>

<p>More necessary! If not to save the children, it should be
done to save the parents.</p>

<p>No matter who the people are, they need the school as a
humanizing force, so that they may feel the common interest,
revive their visions, see the fulfillment of their dreams in
terms of their children, so that they may be made young once
more. Americanize the foreigner, nay, through the child let
us fulfill our destiny and Americanize America.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ANZIA YEZIERSKA</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Anzia Yezierska was born in a Polish province of Russia in the
year 1886, and migrated, when nine years old, to New York City,
where she was sent to work in an East Side sweatshop at a dollar
and a half a week. Her life in America has been a heroic struggle
for self-expression both in a literary and spiritual sense.</p>

<p>Since upon every hand one hears the cry that more should be
required of the immigrants in the way of preparation for citizenship,
in loyalty and in service, it is very fitting that this book of
selections should close with that touching passage of her story, “How
I Found America,” which sets forth the immigrants’ yearning for
fellowship with native Americans and their passionate desire to
serve. Will not here be found the two master keys&mdash;fellowship and
service&mdash;to the successful accomplishment of the work of Americanization;
in fact, without which all attempts at Americanization will
prove futile?</p>

<p>The writings of the immigrants have hitherto been largely historical
and sociological in character. Miss Yezierska’s work suggests
the unlimited artistic possibilities of the newer elements in our national
life,&mdash;gifts on which we should not lay violent hands, but
which we should carefully conserve as a part of the heritage of
America to the future. It is interesting to note that one of her
stories was selected by Edward J. O’Brien as the best piece of imaginative
writing in short form produced during the year 1919.</p>

<p>That part of the story that follows is taken from the issue of <cite>The
Century</cite> for November, 1920. The same story in longer and somewhat
different form is found in a volume of her collected writings
recently published by Houghton Mifflin under the title, “Hungry
Hearts.”</p></div>

<h3>HOW I FOUND AMERICA</h3>

<p>Times changed. The sweat-shop conditions that I had
lived through had become a relic of the past. Wages had
doubled, tripled, and went up higher and higher, and the
working day became shorter and shorter. I began to earn
enough to move my family uptown into a sunny, airy flat
with electricity and telephone service. I even saved up
enough to buy a phonograph and a piano.</p>

<p>My knotted nerves relaxed. At last I had become free
from the worry for bread and rent, but I was not happy. A
more restless discontent than ever before ate out my heart.
Freedom from stomach needs only intensified the needs of my
soul.</p>

<p>I ached and clamored for America. Higher wages and
shorter hours of work, mere physical comfort, were not yet
America. I had dreamed that America was a place where
the heart could grow big with living. Though outwardly I
had become prosperous, life still forced me into an existence
of mere getting and getting.</p>

<p><em>Ach!</em> how I longed for a friend, a real American friend,
some one to whom I could express the thoughts and feelings
that choked me! In the Bronx, the uptown ghetto, I felt
myself farther away from the spirit of America than ever
before. In the East Side the people had yet alive in their
eyes the old, old dreams of America, the America that would
release the age-old hunger to give; but in the prosperous
Bronx good eating and good sleeping replaced the spiritual
need for giving. The chase for dollars and diamonds deadened
the dreams that had once brought them to America.</p>

<p>More and more the all-consuming need for a friend possessed
me. In the street, in the cars, in the subways, I was
always seeking, ceaselessly seeking for eyes, a face, the flash
of a smile that would be light in my darkness.</p>

<p>I felt sometimes that I was only burning out my heart for
a shadow, an echo, a wild dream, but I couldn’t help it.<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
Nothing was real to me but my hope of finding a friend.
America was not America to me unless I could find an
American that would make America real.</p>

<p>The hunger of my heart drove me to the night-school.
Again my dream flamed. Again America beckoned. In the
school there would be education, air, life for my cramped-in
spirit. I would learn to think, to form the thoughts that
surged formless in me. I would find the teacher that would
make me articulate.</p>

<p>I joined the literature class. They were reading “The
De Coverley Papers.” Filled with insatiate thirst, I drank
in every line with the feeling that any moment I would get
to the fountain-heart of revelation. Night after night I read
with tireless devotion. But of what? The manners and
customs of the eighteenth century, of people two hundred
years dead.</p>

<p>One evening, after a month’s attendance, when the class
had dwindled from fifty to four, and the teacher began
scolding us who were present for those who were absent, my
bitterness broke.</p>

<p>“Do you know why all the girls are dropping away from
the class? It’s because they have too much sense than to
waste themselves on ‘The De Coverley Papers.’ Us four
girls are four fools. We could learn more in the streets. It’s
dirty and wrong, but it’s life. What are ‘The De Coverley
Papers?’ Dry dust fit for the ash-can.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better tell the principal your ideas of
the standard classics,” she scoffed, white with rage.</p>

<p>“All right,” I snapped, and hurried down to the principal’s
office.</p>

<p>I swung open the door.</p>

<p>“I just want to tell you why I’m leaving. I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Won’t you come in?” The principal rose and placed a
chair for me near her desk. “Now tell me all.” She leaned
forward with an inviting interest.</p>

<p>I looked up, and met the steady gaze of eyes shining with
light. In a moment all my anger fled. “The De Coverley
Papers” were forgotten. The warm friendliness of her face<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
held me like a familiar dream. I couldn’t speak. It was as
if the sky suddenly opened in my heart.</p>

<p>“Do go on,” she said, and gave me a quick nod. “I want
to hear.”</p>

<p>The repression of centuries rushed out of my heart. I
told her everything&mdash;of the mud hut in Sukovoly where I
was born, of the Czar’s pogroms, of the constant fear of the
Cossack, of Gedalyah Mindel’s letter, of our hopes in coming
to America, and my search for an American who would
make America real.</p>

<p>“I am so glad you came to me,” she said. And after a
pause, “You can help me.”</p>

<p>“Help you?” I cried. It was the first time that an American
suggested that I could help her.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. I have always wanted to know more of that
mysterious, vibrant life&mdash;the immigrant. You can help me
know my girls. You have so much to give&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Give&mdash;that’s what I was hungering and thirsting all
these years&mdash;to give out what’s in me. I was dying in the
unused riches of my soul.”</p>

<p>“I know; I know just what you mean,” she said, putting
her hand on mine.</p>

<p>My whole being seemed to change in the warmth of her
comprehension. “I have a friend,” it sang itself in me. “I
have a friend!”</p>

<p>“And you are a born American?” I asked. There was
none of that sure, all-right look of the Americans about her.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. My mother, like so many mothers,”&mdash;and
her eyebrows lifted humorously whimsical,&mdash;“claims we’re
descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers, and that one of our lineal
ancestors came over in the <em>Mayflower</em>.”</p>

<p>“For all your mother’s pride in the Pilgrim Fathers, you
yourself are as plain from the heart as an immigrant.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t the Pilgrim Fathers immigrants two hundred
years ago?”</p>

<p>She took from her desk a book and read to me.</p>

<p>Then she opened her arms to me, and breathlessly I felt
myself drawn to her. Bonds seemed to burst. A suffusion<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
of light filled my being. Great choirings lifted me in space.
I walked out unseeingly.</p>

<p>All the way home the words she read flamed before me:
“We go forth all to seek America. And in the seeking we
create her. In the quality of our search shall be the nature
of the America that we create.”</p>

<p>So all those lonely years of seeking and praying were not
in vain. How glad I was that I had not stopped at the husk,
a good job, a good living! Through my inarticulate groping
and reaching out I had found the soul, the spirit of America.</p>

legislative assemblies,” when tracing the consequences likely to result
from the oppressive acts of parliament. “Their governments,” observed
this orator, “are popular in a high degree; some are merely popular;
in all, the popular representative is the most weighty; and this share
of the people, in their ordinary government, never fails to inspire them
with lofty sentiments, and with a strong aversion from whatever
tends to deprive them of their chief importance.” (Author’s note.)</p></div>
